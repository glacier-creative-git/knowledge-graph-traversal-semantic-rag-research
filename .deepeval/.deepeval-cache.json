The field of information ethics was established by mathematician Norbert Wiener in the 1940s. Research conducted by McKinsey in collaboration with the University of Oxford suggested that half of all large-scale IT projects (those with initial cost estimates of $15 million or more) often failed to maintain costs within their initial budgets or to complete on time.\", \"The conceptual foundations of computer ethics are investigated by information ethics, a branch of philosophical ethics promoted, among others, by Luciano Floridi. The concept of computer ethics originated in the 1940s with MIT professor Norbert Wiener, the American mathematician and philosopher. While working on anti-aircraft artillery during World War II, Wiener and his fellow engineers developed a system of communication between the part of a cannon that tracked a warplane, the part that performed calculations to estimate a trajectory, and the part responsible for firing.\", \"The term \\\"computer ethics\\\" was thus invented. He noticed a need for a different branch of ethics for when it came to dealing with computers. The responsibilities of those working in the field include network administration, software development and installation, and the planning and management of an organization's technology life cycle, by which hardware and software are maintained, upgraded, and replaced.\", \"Wiener termed the science of such information feedback systems, \\\"cybernetics,\\\" and he discussed this new field with its related ethical concerns in his 1948 book, Cybernetics.

Early computers had very limited connections to other devices, but perhaps the first example of computer networking occurred in 1940 when George Stibitz connected a terminal at Dartmouth to his Complex Number Calculator at Bell Labs in New York. In order to communicate, the computers and devices must be connected by a physical medium that supports transmission of information.\", \"The same program in its human-readable source code form, enables a programmer to study and develop a sequence of steps known as an algorithm.

Two regions showed a statistically significant association. In the amygdala, 66% of studies inducing fear reported activity in this region, as compared to ~20% of studies inducing happiness, ~15% of studies inducing sadness (with no reported activations for anger or disgust).\", \"Happiness: the ventral tegmental area works closely with the prefrontal cortex to produce emotions of happiness as they lie upon the same dopamine pathways. Emotion activates several areas of the brain inside the limbic system and varies per emotion: Fear: the amygdala is the main component for acquisition, storage, and expression of fear. Immediate emotions are considered true emotions which integrates cognition with somatic or bodily components of the autonomic nervous system to express the emotion externally.\", \"In the subcallosal cingulate, 46% of studies inducing sadness reported activity in this region, as compared to ~20% inducing happiness and ~20% inducing anger. Lesions on the central amygdaloid can lead to disruptions in the behavioral and autonomic emotional responses of fear. Anger/aggression: the hypothalamus and amygdala work together to send inhibitory/excitatory impulses to the periaqueductal gray which then carries out usually defensive behaviors.\", \"Krings et al. found that the professional piano players showed lower levels of cortical activation in motor areas of the brain.
