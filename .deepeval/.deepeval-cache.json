By contrast, trait theorists have developed taxonomies of personality constructs in describing personality in terms of key traits. Trait theorists have often employed statistical data-reduction methods, such as factor analysis.\", \"Just as the Eysenck model and Golderberg/McCrae and Costa's model disagree fundamentally on the numbers of factors (three versus five, respectively), there exists ongoing debates about the numbers of orthogonal factors that may be sufficient to define the personality space. Idiographic approach emphasizes individuality and defines traits, including individualized traits and the pattern or organization of a combination of traits, in relation to a particular person. Along with the development of the factor analysis and psychometrics, the nomothetic approach has been dominant in personality psychology as it offers quantitative measures of traits that can be easily incorporated in research designs and statistical analyses.\", \"Raymond Cattell empirically derived a theory of 16 personality factors at the primary-factor level and up to eight broader second-stratum factors. Although the number of proposed traits has varied widely, Hans Eysenck's early biologically based model suggests at least three major trait constructs are necessary to describe human personality, extraversion-introversion, neuroticism-stability, and psychoticism-normality. Two popular models of personality traits are Eysenck's three-factor model (including three factors: neuroticism, extraversion, and psychoticism) and Goldberg's Big Five or McCrae and Costa's five-factor model (including five factors: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and impulsivity/openness), in which the latter two are made up of slightly different dimensions but often conceptualized interchangeably in the literature.\", \"Since the 1980s, the Big Five (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) emerged as an important trait theory of personality. Dimensional models of personality disorders are receiving increasing support, and a version of dimensional assessment, namely the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders, has been included in the DSM-5. However, despite a plethora of research into the various versions of the \\\"Big Five\\\" personality dimensions, it appears necessary to move on from static conceptualizations of personality structure to a more dynamic orientation, acknowledging that personality constructs are subject to learning and change over the lifespan.\"], \"expected_output\": \"The nomothetic approach defines

By contrast, trait theorists have developed taxonomies of personality constructs in describing personality in terms of key traits. Trait theorists have often employed statistical data-reduction methods, such as factor analysis.\", \"Just as the Eysenck model and Golderberg/McCrae and Costa's model disagree fundamentally on the numbers of factors (three versus five, respectively), there exists ongoing debates about the numbers of orthogonal factors that may be sufficient to define the personality space.

Although the number of proposed traits has varied widely, Hans Eysenck's early biologically based model suggests at least three major trait constructs are necessary to describe human personality, extraversion-introversion, neuroticism-stability, and psychoticism-normality. Two popular models of personality traits are Eysenck's three-factor model (including three factors: neuroticism, extraversion, and psychoticism) and Goldberg's Big Five or McCrae and Costa's five-factor model (including five factors: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and impulsivity/openness), in which the latter two are made up of slightly different dimensions but often conceptualized interchangeably in the literature.\", \"Since the 1980s, the Big Five (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) emerged as an important trait theory of personality. Dimensional models of personality disorders are receiving increasing support, and a version of dimensional assessment, namely the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders, has been included in the DSM-5.

By contrast, trait theorists have developed taxonomies of personality constructs in describing personality in terms of key traits. Trait theorists have often employed statistical data-reduction methods, such as factor analysis.\", \"Just as the Eysenck model and Golderberg/McCrae and Costa's model disagree fundamentally on the numbers of factors (three versus five, respectively), there exists ongoing debates about the numbers of orthogonal factors that may be sufficient to define the personality space. Idiographic approach emphasizes individuality and defines traits, including individualized traits and the pattern or organization of a combination of traits, in relation to a particular person. Along with the development of the factor analysis and psychometrics, the nomothetic approach has been dominant in personality psychology as it offers quantitative measures of traits that can be easily incorporated in research designs and statistical analyses.\", \"Raymond Cattell empirically derived a theory of 16 personality factors at the primary-factor level and up to eight broader second-stratum factors. Although the number of proposed traits has varied widely, Hans Eysenck's early biologically based model suggests at least three major trait constructs are necessary to describe human personality, extraversion-introversion, neuroticism-stability, and psychoticism-normality. Two popular models of personality traits are Eysenck's three-factor model (including three factors: neuroticism, extraversion, and psychoticism) and Goldberg's Big Five or McCrae and Costa's five-factor model (including five factors: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and impulsivity/openness), in which the latter two are made up of slightly different dimensions but often conceptualized interchangeably in the literature.\", \"Since the 1980s, the Big Five (openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) emerged as an important trait theory of personality. Dimensional models of personality disorders are receiving increasing support, and a version of dimensional assessment, namely the Alternative DSM-5 Model for Personality Disorders, has been included in the DSM-5. However, despite a plethora of research into the various versions of the \\\"Big Five\\\" personality dimensions, it appears necessary to move on from static conceptualizations of personality structure to a more dynamic orientation, acknowledging that personality constructs are subject to learning and change over the lifespan.\"], \"expected_output\": \"The nomothetic approach defines

During learning, information processing in the brain involves induction of oxidative modification in neuronal DNA followed by the employment of DNA repair processes that introduce epigenetic alterations.\", \"In particular, the DNA repair processes of non-homologous end joining and base excision repair are employed in learning and memory formation.

The pattern of induced and repressed genes in brain neurons subsequent to an intense learning event likely provides the molecular basis for a long-term memory of the event. Demethylation is carried out by several proteins acting in concert, including the TET enzymes as well as enzymes of the DNA base excision repair pathway (see Epigenetics in learning and memory).\", \"Such a learning experience appears to rapidly trigger TOP2B to induce double-strand breaks in the promoter DNA of IEG genes that function in neuroplasticity.
