The field of information ethics was established by mathematician Norbert Wiener in the 1940s. Research conducted by McKinsey in collaboration with the University of Oxford suggested that half of all large-scale IT projects (those with initial cost estimates of $15 million or more) often failed to maintain costs within their initial budgets or to complete on time.\", \"The conceptual foundations of computer ethics are investigated by information ethics, a branch of philosophical ethics promoted, among others, by Luciano Floridi. The concept of computer ethics originated in the 1940s with MIT professor Norbert Wiener, the American mathematician and philosopher. While working on anti-aircraft artillery during World War II, Wiener and his fellow engineers developed a system of communication between the part of a cannon that tracked a warplane, the part that performed calculations to estimate a trajectory, and the part responsible for firing.\", \"The term \\\"computer ethics\\\" was thus invented. He noticed a need for a different branch of ethics for when it came to dealing with computers. The responsibilities of those working in the field include network administration, software development and installation, and the planning and management of an organization's technology life cycle, by which hardware and software are maintained, upgraded, and replaced.\", \"Wiener termed the science of such information feedback systems, \\\"cybernetics,\\\" and he discussed this new field with its related ethical concerns in his 1948 book, Cybernetics.
