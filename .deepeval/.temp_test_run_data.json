The model also shows all the memory stores as being a single unit whereas research into this shows differently. For example, short-term memory can be broken up into different units such as visual information and acoustic information.", "For instance, long-term memory is believed to be actually made up of multiple subcomponents, such as episodic and procedural memory. The multi-store model has been criticised for being too simplistic. A large part of memory is forgetting, and there is a large debate among psychologists of decay theory versus interference theory.", "Modern conceptions of memory are usually about long-term memory and break it down into three main sub-classes. These three classes are somewhat hierarchical in nature, in terms of the level of conscious thought related to their use. It takes into account both visual and auditory stimuli, long-term memory to use as a reference, and a central processor to combine and understand it all.", "One of the most regarded is the Baddeley and Hitch model of working memory. In 1974 Baddeley and Hitch proposed a \"working memory model\" that replaced the general concept of short-term memory with active maintenance of information in short-term storage. In this model, working memory consists of three basic stores: the central executive, the phonological loop, and the visuo-spatial sketchpad.", "In 2000 this model was expanded with the multimodal episodic buffer (Baddeley's model of working memory). Visual short-term memory was unaffected, suggesting a dichotomy between visual and audial memory.
