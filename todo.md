1. Evolutions are global right now. it would be really awesome if they were context-group-dependent so that each context group had its own evolution, so that it was more fine tuned. That way it wasn't just like evolutions were just blasting spray paint across the whole dataset lmao.
3. Visualizations! I want to know if we can add them in during dataset generation. It would be very very helpful to see if we can observe them so we know our dataset context grouping algorithms are working as intended.
