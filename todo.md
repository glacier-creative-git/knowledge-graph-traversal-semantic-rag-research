1. Knowledge graph context grouping algorithm allows for freedom but it basically ONLY ends up just "reading" lmao. We need to add in something like a check that makes it so it does NOT traverse to a chunk that contains a sentence we've already added, to disincentivize it from traversing to neighboring sliding windows. Or something else that allows it to explore more.
   2. Check to see if I fixed this? I think I enabled not leaping to chunks that contain sentences we've already seen, but I don't know if that's on both the retrieval algo AND the context grouping algo. Have to see.
2. Theme based is totally broken, it defaults to the inter chunk basically immediately, need to figure out what's wrong, not sure what it is at all yet.
3. Inter document is really cool actually. It oscillates between documents back and forth, which I didn't expect, and want to actually explore further. But there's a chance that sentences in one of the two or more documents being traversed aren't getting added to the list for some reason. Look at the current knowledge graph traversal data entry in the synthetic_dataset.json to see it.
4. Evolutions are global right now. it would be really awesome if they were context-group-dependent so that each context group had its own evolution, so that it was more fine tuned. That way it wasn't just like evolutions were just blasting spray paint across the whole dataset lmao.
5. There are still some chances that we aren't completely deduplicating sentences but I'm not quite sure yet. Still need to check all 5 context grouping algorithms to test and see if it's working correctly.}
   6. I think we fixed this? I don't know. This is based on the context grouping algos.
6. Visualizations! I want to know if we can add them in during dataset generation. It would be very very helpful to see if we can observe them so we know our dataset context grouping algorithms are working as intended.
7. Knowledge graph traversal algorithm is borked due to some kind of similarity comparison issue happening. The added check of sentence level comparisons to enable early stopping seems to not be working, or there's some oversight in the code causing issues.
