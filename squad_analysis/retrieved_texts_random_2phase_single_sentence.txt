1. The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle.

2. In the cycle, water is heated and transforms into steam within a boiler operating at a high pressure.

3. The reduced-pressure steam is then condensed and pumped back into the boiler.

4. The Rankine cycle and most practical steam engines have a water pump to recycle or top up the boiler water, so that they may be run continuously.

5. Non-combustion heat sources such as solar power, nuclear power or geothermal energy may be used.

6. Another means of supplying lower-pressure boiler feed water is an injector, which uses a steam jet usually supplied from the boiler.

7. When expanded through pistons or turbines, mechanical work is done.

8. Utility and industrial boilers commonly use multi-stage centrifugal pumps; however, other types are used.

9. Steam engines are external combustion engines, where the working fluid is separate from the combustion products.
