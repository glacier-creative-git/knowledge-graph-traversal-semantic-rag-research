    "\n",
    "Semantic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems for large language models (LLM's) invoke a pipeline of retrieving semantically relevant and accurate information to a user's query and feeding it into an LLM so that it provides a relevant and accurate answer. Research has been underway for several years regarding ways to enhance the performance, and accuracy of these systems, to maximize LLM effectiveness. This notebook details the research and discovery process of novel semantic retrieval augmented generation traversal algorithms, from beginning to end. \n",
    "\n",
    "My initial introduction to semantic RAG was by focusing on solving the chunking problem via the since-depreciated Bittensor \"Chunking Subnet.\" This subnet focused on novel methods of semantic chunking, with a very specific reward heuristic, and it was by optimizing for this reward heuristic I discovered a way of visualizing and structuring documents based on semantic similarity by creating a similarity matrix of all pairwise sentence comparisons in a `numpy` array and architecting chunking algorithms from there."

    "As I learned more about the full semantic RAG pipeline I realized that *chunking might not even be an issue.* By sparsely connecting documents together based on semantic similarity, you can create a *knowledge graph* in which each chunk or sentence is connected to others that are similar. This is not necessarily new, as Microsoft discovered GraphRAG in its own research, but I experiemented with different knowledge graph architectures to see where opportunity might be. Specifically with respect to maximizing retrieval quality within semantic RAG systems as a whole."

    "During this process, I wondered if *knowledge graphs can be traversed.* As it turns out, *yes it's possible,* but precision and accuracy were yet to be determined. How does one algorithmically determine where to traverse to? Where to start and when to stop? And is it any better than basic semantic RAG with traditional blob vector storage? With this goal in mind, I discovered a custom knowledge graph architecture that is specifically designed to be traversed very rapidly, and designed *three basic traversal algorithms* that can be used to traverse a knowledge graph to retrieve contexts. These algorithms are the core of the completed research here and their strengths and weaknesses will be demonstrated in this notebook."

    "# 1.0: Identifying the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use natural language processing to talk to LLM's, we need to ensure we give them semantically relevant, accurate information. We also want to make sure we don't give them *too* much information as well, otherwise they are likely to provide inaccurate information, or hallucinate. This is why we build RAG systems that allow us to retrieve relevant information so that a model can give an accurate output based on the user's input prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say a user talks to an LLM about a question inside a document. A typical LLM pipeline might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Prior to any user interaction, the document would be chunked according to semantic similarity, and these chunks of text would be stored in a \"vector store\" for retrieval upon prompting (explained later).\n",
    "1. User inputs a prompt into an LLM.\n",
    "2. User's prompt is first directly fed to an embedding model.\n",
    "3. Embedding is sent to the vector store service that hosts the document's text and embeddings, almost like a \"library lookup\" for relevant text.\n",
    "4. Most semantically relevant text from the document is returned back to the model as additional context, along with the original text prompt.\n",
    "5. LLM is able to answer the question accurately and reliably without becoming overloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic RAG pipelines are typical engineered based on use-case. Retrieving medical papers or court documents is much different than retrieving Harry Potter novels. This being said, each step in the process has its own fine-tuning to be done, and like I said before, my original introduction into semantic RAG was through the chunking problem."

    "# 2.0: Solving Semantic RAG Chunking Through Bittensor\n",
    "\n",
    "The beginning of this research started via *semantic RAG chunking.*\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you separate a Harry Potter article into paragraphs, without having the indentations? What about a phone book, or an excel spreadsheet full of medical records? What about a long series of emails across multiple topics? This is the core problem of chunking; which is separating out chunks of documents based on semantic similarity. It's an arguably infinitely complex problem. Not because humans can't do it, but because there's technically no right or wrong answer. Chunking heavily depends on the use-case of the documents being chunked. And how does one measure \"accurate\" chunking to begin with anyway?\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter Bittensor; a network of engineers being incentivized to solve impossible problems. From 2024-2025, the subnet known as Chunking, set out to solve this exact problem, with its own reward structure and heuristic for doing so. Miners were tasked with chunking documents based semantic similarity, using their own custom algorithms, and competed to return the \"best\" possible chunked documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next section comes directly from the evaluation documentation from Chunking and it outlines the reward heuristic in detail."

    "## Reward Function\n",
    "\n",
    "This subnet incentivizes responses that maximize intrachunk similarity and interchunk dissimilarity, without exceeding variable constraints, such as time or maximum chunk length. This subnet measures similarity by the dot product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the similarity score can be influenced significantly by the content in the provided document, evaluation is always done relatively, within groups of miners that all faced the same query. See [Incentive Mechanism](./incentive_mechanism.md) to learn more.\n",

    "### 1. No new words\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the validator confirms that each word in the chunked response also exists, in the same order, in the original document.\n",

    "## Evaluating\n",
    "\n",
    "After passing the fail states, the validator parses through each chunk, creating 'small chunks' of 3 sentences or fewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create test segments\n",
    "sentences = sent_tokenize(chunks[i])\n",
    "for j in range(0, len(sentences), 3):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to calculate the similarity score, the dot product of every possible pair of embeddings is calculated. The average of each pair originating from the same chunk is added to the score (intrachunk similarity), while the average of each pair originating from different chunks is subtracted from the score (interchunk dissimilarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "This method of scoring chunks was applied to fully chunked documents, typically resulted in a score near `1.0`, using the `text-embedding-ada-002` model from OpenAI. Crucially, the subnet required all chunks in the document to be within a max chunk size and chunk quantity. By maximizing the difference between intrachunk and interchunk similarity across many random samples, while staying within a max chunk size and max chunk quantity, algorithms highly optimized for this heuristic gradually produced better scores over time."

This also includes *between-document connections*. \n",

These 5 themes then get passed down to *all chunk and sentence nodes* inside that particular document.
