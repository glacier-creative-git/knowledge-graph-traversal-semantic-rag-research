Test Phase 6: Knowledge Graph Assembly with Theme Bridges
========================================================

Test script to verify Phase 6 (Knowledge Graph Assembly) functionality.
Tests assembly of knowledge graph using pre-computed similarities (Phase 4)
and extracted entities/themes (Phase 5) with new cross-document theme bridging.

NEW PHASE STRUCTURE:
- Phase 1: Setup & Initialization
- Phase 2: Data Acquisition
- Phase 3: Multi-Granularity Embedding Generation
- Phase 4: Multi-Granularity Similarity Matrix Construction
- Phase 5: Entity/Theme Extraction (NEW)
- Phase 6: Knowledge Graph Assembly (NEW - this test)
- Phase 7: Question Generation (renamed from old Phase 6)

Run from project root:
