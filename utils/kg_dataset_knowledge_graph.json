        "page_content": "The biochemistry of Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia, is not yet very well understood. Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been identified as a proteopathy: a protein misfolding disease due to the accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta (Aβ) protein in the brain. Amyloid beta is a short peptide that is an abnormal proteolytic byproduct of the transmembrane protein amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), whose function is unclear but thought to be involved in neuronal development.  The presenilins are components of proteolytic complex involved in APP processing and degradation.\nAmyloid beta monomers are soluble and contain short regions of beta sheet and polyproline II helix secondary structures in solution, though they are largely alpha helical in membranes; however, at sufficiently high concentration, they undergo a dramatic conformational change to form a beta sheet-rich tertiary structure that aggregates to form amyloid fibrils. These fibrils and oligomeric forms of Aβ deposit outside neurons in formations known as senile plaques. There are different types of plaques, including the diffuse, compact, cored or neuritic plaque types, as well as Aβ deposits in the walls of small blood vessel walls in the brain called cerebral amyloid angiopathy.\nAD is also considered a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein, a microtubule-associated protein expressed in neurons that normally acts to stabilize microtubules in the cell cytoskeleton. Like most microtubule-associated proteins, tau is normally regulated by phosphorylation; however, in Alzheimer's disease, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates as paired helical filaments that in turn aggregate into masses inside nerve cell bodies known as neurofibrillary tangles and as dystrophic neurites associated with amyloid plaques. Although little is known about the process of filament assembly, depletion of a prolyl isomerase protein in the parvulin family has been shown to accelerate the accumulation of abnormal tau.\nNeuroinflammation is also involved in the complex cascade leading to AD pathology and symptoms. Considerable pathological and clinical evidence documents immunological changes associated with AD, including increased pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Whether these changes may be a cause or consequence of AD remains to be fully understood, but inflammation within the brain, including increased reactivity of the resident microglia towards amyloid deposits, has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Much of the known biochemistry of Alzheimer's disease has been deciphered through research using experimental models of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n== Neuropathology ==\nAt a macroscopic level, AD is characterized by loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions. This results in gross atrophy of the affected regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, and parts of the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus.\nBoth amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are clearly visible by microscopy in AD brains. Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of protein and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles are insoluble twisted fibers that build up inside the nerve cell. Though many older people develop some plaques and tangles, the brains of AD patients have them to a much greater extent and in different brain locations.\n\n\n== Biochemical characteristics ==\nFundamental to the understanding of Alzheimer's disease is the biochemical events that leads to accumulation of the amyloid-beta plaques and tau-protein tangles. A delicate balance of the enzymes secretases regulate the amyloid-beta accumulation. Recently, a link between cholinergic neuronal activity and the activity of alpha-secretase has been highlighted, which can discourage amyloid-beta proteins deposition in brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.  \nAlzheimer's dis",

        "page_content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people across the globe. It is also a topic of interest in the East Asian population, especially as the burden of disease increases due to aging and population growth. The pathogenesis of AD between ethnic groups is different. However, prior studies in AD pathology have focused primarily on populations of European ancestry and may not give adequate insight on the genetic, clinical, and biological differences found in East Asians with AD. Gaps in knowledge regarding Alzheimer's disease in the East Asian population introduce serious barriers to screening, early prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and timely intervention.\n\n\n== Prevalence ==\n\nThe prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is significant in East Asian countries compared to the global average, which has 667 cases per 100,000 people. Japan has the highest prevalence of AD in the world at 3,079 cases per 100,000 population. South Korea and China have 1119 and 924 cases per 100,000 people, respectively. China has the highest number of people with dementia in the world at 13.1 million cases. Women were found to have higher rates of AD, potentially due to higher estrogen levels. According to a study, early menopause could be a contributing factor to an increased risk of AD. The prevalence is higher in older individuals and in rural areas.\nIn North America, the rates of Alzheimer's disease in Asian Americans were found to be similar to Non-Hispanic whites and lower compared to Black Americans and Hispanic Americans. Japanese Americans were found to have increased AD prevalence compared to other Asian American subgroups. In terms of trends, Japan has experienced a rapid increase in prevalence rates relative to the global average, from 772 cases per 100,000 in 1990 to 3029 cases per 100,000 in 2019. Japan is also expected to have the highest dementia-related death rates by 2040.\n\n\n== Risk factors and co-morbidities ==\n\nAge and genetics have consistently been the strongest predictors of dementia and AD. However, lifestyle factors and other co-morbidities can play a significant role in contributing to AD susceptibility.\n\n\n=== Demographic risk factors ===\nOlder age is a significant risk factor for dementia, with the rate of cognitive decline being tenfold greater in the last three years of life. Income, occupation, and education are associated with the risk of developing AD in East Asian populations. Higher education generally indicates lower risk of AD. More physical or unsafe workplace conditions are associated with increased risk of AD.\n\n\n=== Behavioral and physiological risk factors ===\nSmoking, low social activity, and low physical activity are risk factors for AD in East Asian populations. Vascular conditions such as high blood pressure are also linked to dementia later in life. A sedentary lifestyle or obesity are believed to contribute to dementia susceptibility. Specifically, lower body mass index (BMI) may contribute to a lower likelihood of dementia. A healthy diet high in fish, fruit, Vegetables, and legumes but lower in meat and dairy is associated with decreased risk of AD. Regular consumption of vegetable and fruit juices may decrease AD risk due to the intake of popyphenols. Abnormal levels of insulin and impaired glucose tolerance is connected to increased dementia susceptibility in East Asians. Poor early life environmental factors contribute to longer duration or more rapidly progressing AD later in life. Moreover, heavy metal exposures, such as lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic, have been found to induce neurotoxicity, leading to an increased risk of AD. Daytime sleepiness and sleep apnea may have a relationship with later cognitive decline and dementia. A study of Japanese Americans found that mid-life proteinuria and impaired renal function may be an independent predictor of late-life dementia.\n\n\n=== Comorbidities ===\nDiabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular d",

        "page_content": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease and is the most common form of dementia accounting for around 60–70% of cases. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events. As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, self-neglect, and behavioral issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to twelve years.\nThe causes of Alzheimer's disease remain poorly understood. There are many environmental and genetic risk factors associated with its development. The strongest genetic risk factor is from an allele of apolipoprotein E. Other risk factors include a history of head injury, clinical depression, and high blood pressure. The progression of the disease is largely characterised by the accumulation of malformed protein deposits in the cerebral cortex, called amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. These misfolded protein aggregates interfere with normal cell function, and over time lead to irreversible degeneration of neurons and loss of synaptic connections in the brain. A probable diagnosis is based on the history of the illness and cognitive testing, with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes. Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal brain aging. Examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis, but this can only take place after death.\nNo treatments can stop or reverse its progression, though some may temporarily improve symptoms. A healthy diet, physical activity, and social engagement are generally beneficial in aging, and may help in reducing the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's. Affected people become increasingly reliant on others for assistance, often placing a burden on caregivers. The pressures can include social, psychological, physical, and economic elements. Exercise programs may be beneficial with respect to activities of daily living and can potentially improve outcomes. Behavioral problems or psychosis due to dementia are sometimes treated with antipsychotics, but this has an increased risk of early death.\nAs of 2020, there were approximately 50 million people worldwide with Alzheimer's disease. It most often begins in people over 65 years of age, although up to 10% of cases are early-onset impacting those in their 30s to mid-60s. It affects about 6% of people 65 years and older, and women more often than men. The disease is named after German psychiatrist and pathologist Alois Alzheimer, who first described it in 1906. Alzheimer's financial burden on society is large, with an estimated global annual cost of US$1 trillion. It is ranked as the seventh leading cause of death worldwide. \nGiven the widespread impacts of Alzheimer's disease, both basic-science and health funders in many countries support Alzheimer's research at large scales. For example, the US National Institutes of Health program for Alzheimer's research, the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, has a budget of US$3.98 billion for fiscal year 2026. In the European Union, the 2020 Horizon Europe research programme awarded over €570 million for dementia-related projects.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nThe course of Alzheimer's is generally described in three stages, with a progressive pattern of cognitive and functional impairment. The three stages are described as early or mild, middle or moderate, and late or severe. The disease is known to target the hippocampus which is associated with memory, and this is responsible for the first symptoms of memory impairment.

Men and women appear to be equally affected. FTD generally presents as a behavioral or language disorder with gradual onset. Signs and symptoms tend to appear in mid adulthood, typically between the ages of 45 and 65, although it can affect people younger or older than this. There is currently no cure or approved symptomatic treatment for FTD, although some off-label drugs and behavioral methods are prescribed.\nFeatures of FTD were first described by Arnold Pick between 1892 and 1906. The name Pick's disease was coined in 1922. This term is now reserved only for the behavioral variant of FTD, in which characteristic Pick bodies and Pick cells are present. These were first described by Alois Alzheimer in 1911. Common signs and symptoms include significant changes in social and personal behavior, disinhibition, apathy, blunting and dysregulation of emotions, and deficits in both expressive and receptive language.\nEach FTD subtype is relatively rare. FTDs are mostly early onset syndromes linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), which is characterized by progressive neuronal loss predominantly involving the frontal or temporal lobes, and a typical loss of more than 70% of spindle neurons, while other neuron types remain intact. The three main subtypes or variant syndromes are a behavioral variant (bvFTD) previously known as Pick's disease, and two variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA): semantic (svPPA) and nonfluent (nfvPPA). Two rare distinct subtypes of FTD are neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID) and basophilic inclusion body disease (BIBD). Other related disorders include corticobasal syndrome (CBS or CBD), and FTD with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nFrontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an early onset disorder that mostly occurs between the ages of 45 and 65, but can begin earlier, and in 20–25% of cases onset is later. Men and women appear to be equally affected. It is the most common early presenting dementia. FTD is the second most prevalent type of early onset dementia after Alzheimer's disease.\nThe International Classification of Diseases recognizes the disease as causative to disorders affecting mental and behavioural aspects in humans.  Dissociation from family, compulsive buying disorder (oniomania), vulgar speech characteristics, screaming, inability to control emotions, behavior, personality, and temperament are characteristic social display patterns. A gradual onset and progression of changes in behavior or language deficits are reported to have begun several years prior to presentation to a neurologist.\n\n\n== Subtypes and related disorders ==\nThe main subtypes of frontotemporal dementia are behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD), two variants of primary progressive aphasia – semantic dementia (svPPA) and progressive nonfluent aphasia (nfvPPA) – as well as FTD associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FTD–ALS or FTD-MND). Two distinct rare subtypes are neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID), and basophilic inclusion body disease (BIBD). Related disorders are corticobasal syndrome (CBS or CBD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).\n\n\n=== Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia ===\nBehavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (BvFTD) was previously known as Pick's disease, and is the most common of the FTD types. BvFTD is diagnosed four times as often as the PPA variants. Behavior can change in BvFTD in either of two ways—it can change to being impulsive and disinhibited, acting in socially unacceptable ways; or it can change to being listless and apathetic. About 12–13% of people with bvFTD develop motor neuron disease.\nThe Pick bodies which are present in behavioral variant FTD are spherical i",

It is one of the two Lewy body dementias, along with Parkinson's disease dementia.\nDementia with Lewy bodies can be classified in other ways. The atypical parkinsonian syndromes include DLB, along with other conditions. Also, DLB is a synucleinopathy, meaning that it is characterized by abnormal deposits of alpha-synuclein protein in the brain. The synucleinopathies include Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and other rarer conditions.\nThe vocabulary of diseases associated with Lewy pathology causes confusion. Lewy body dementia (the umbrella term that encompasses the clinical diagnoses of dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia) differs from Lewy body disease (the term used to describe pathological findings of Lewy bodies on autopsy). Because individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) are often found on autopsy to also have Lewy bodies, DLB has been characterized as an Alzheimer disease-related dementia; the term Lewy body variant of Alzheimer disease is no longer",

In 2018 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo \"for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation.\" Cancer immunotherapy attempts to stimulate the immune system to destroy tumours. A variety of strategies are in use or are undergoing research and testing. Randomized controlled studies in different cancers resulting in significant increase in survival and disease free period have been reported and its efficacy is enhanced by 20–30% when cell-based immunotherapy is combined with conventional treatment methods.\nOne of the oldest forms of cancer immunotherapy is the use of BCG vaccine, which was originally to vaccinate against tuberculosis and later was found to be useful in the treatment of bladder cancer. BCG immunotherapy induces both local and systemic immune responses. The mechanisms by which BCG immunotherapy mediates tumor immunity have been widely studied, but they are still not completely understood.\nThe use of monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy was first introduced in 1997 with rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody for treatment of B cell lymphoma.

Topical immunotherapy utilizes an immune enhancement cream (imiquimod) which produces interferon, causing the recipient's killer T cells to destroy warts, actinic keratoses, basal cell cancer, vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia, squamous cell cancer, cutaneous lymphoma, and superficial malignant melanoma. Injection immunotherapy (\"intralesional\" or \"intratumoural\") uses mumps, candida, the HPV vaccine or trichophytin antigen injections to treat warts (HPV induced tumours).\nAdoptive cell transfer has been tested on lung and other cancers, with greatest success achieved in melanoma.\n\n\n==== Dendritic cell-based pump-priming or vaccination ====\nDendritic cells (DC) can be stimulated to activate a cytotoxic response towards an antigen.

Most people with bladder cancer are diagnosed after noticing blood in their urine. Those suspected of having bladder cancer typically have their bladder inspected by a thin medical camera, a procedure called cystoscopy. Suspected tumors are removed and examined to determine if they are cancerous. Based on how far the tumor has spread, the cancer case is assigned a stage 0 to 4; a higher stage indicates a more widespread and dangerous disease. \nThose whose bladder tumors have not spread outside the bladder have the best prognoses. These tumors are typically surgically removed, and the person is treated with chemotherapy or one of several immune-stimulating therapies. Those whose tumors continue to grow, or whose tumors have penetrated the bladder muscle, often have their bladder surgically removed (radical cystectomy). People whose tumors have spread beyond the bladder have the worst prognoses; on average they survive a year from diagnosis. These people are treated with chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors, followed by enfortumab vedotin.\nAround 500,000 people are diagnosed with bladder cancer each year, and 200,000 die of the disease. The risk of bladder cancer increases with age and the average age at diagnosis is 73. Tobacco smoking is the greatest contributor to bladder cancer risk, and causes around half of bladder cancer cases. Exposure to certain toxic chemicals or the tropical bladder infection schistosomiasis also increases the risk.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n\nThe most common symptom of bladder cancer is visible blood in the urine (haematuria) despite painless urination. This affects around 75% of people eventually diagnosed with the disease. Some instead have \"microscopic haematuria\" – small amounts of blood in the urine that can only be seen under a microscope during urinalysis – pain while urinating, or no symptoms at all (their tumors are detected during unrelated medical imaging). Less commonly, a tumor can block the flow of urine into the bladder; backed up urine can cause the kidneys to swell resulting in pain along the flank of the body between the ribs and the hips. Most people with blood in the urine do not have bladder cancer; up to 22% of those with visible haematuria and 5% with microscopic haematuria are diagnosed with the disease. Women with bladder cancer and haematuria are often misdiagnosed with urinary tract infections, delaying appropriate diagnosis and treatment. \nAround 3% of people with bladder cancer have tumors that have already spread (metastasized) outside the bladder at the time of diagnosis. Bladder cancer most commonly spreads to the bones, lungs, liver, and nearby lymph nodes. Tumors cause different symptoms in each location. People whose cancer has metastasized to the bones most often experience bone pain or bone weakness that increases the risk of fractures. Lung tumors can cause persistent cough, coughing up blood, breathlessness, or recurrent chest infections. Cancer that has spread to the liver can cause general malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, abdominal pain or swelling, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and skin itch. Spreading to nearby lymph nodes can cause pain and swelling around the affected lymph nodes, typically in the abdomen or groin.\n\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nThose suspected of having bladder cancer undergo several tests to assess the presence and extent of any tumors. The gold standard is cystoscopy, wherein a flexible camera is threaded through the urethra and into the bladder to visually inspect for cancerous tissue. Cystoscopy is most efficient at detecting papillary tumors (tumors with a finger-like shape that grow into the urine-holding part of the bladder); it is less efficient with small, low-lying carcinoma in situ (CIS). CIS detection is improved by blue light cystoscopy, where a d",

The interaction of these cell surface proteins is involved in the suppression of the immune system and occurs following infection to limit the killing of bystander host cells and prevent autoimmune disease. This immune checkpoint is also active in pregnancy, following tissue allografts, and in different types of cancer.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of blocking PD-1 and PD-L1 for the treatment of cancer was first published in 2001. Pharmaceutical companies began attempting to develop drugs to block these molecules, and the first clinical trial was launched in 2006, evaluating nivolumab. As of 2017, more than 500 clinical trials involving PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors have been conducted in more than 20,000 patients. By the end of 2017, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors had been approved for the treatment of nine forms of cancer.\n\n\n== Cancer immunotherapy ==\nIn the cancer disease state, the interaction of PD-L1 on the tumor cells with PD-1 on a T-cell reduces T-cell function signals to prevent the immune system from attacking the tumor cells. Use of an inhibitor that blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with the PD-1 receptor can prevent the cancer from evading the immune system in this way. Several PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors are being trialled within the clinic for use in advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, bladder cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma, amongst other cancer types.\nImmunotherapy with these immune checkpoint inhibitors appears to shrink tumours in a higher number of patients across a wider range of tumour types and is associated with lower toxicity levels than other immunotherapies, with durable responses. However, de-novo and acquired resistance is still seen in a large proportion of patients. Hence PD-L1 inhibitors are considered to be the most promising drug category for many different cancers.\nNot all patients respond to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The FDA has approved several assays to measure the level of PD-L1 expressed by tumor cells, in order to predict the likelihood of response to an inhibitor. PD-L1 levels have been found to be highly predictive of response. Higher tumor mutational burden is also predictive of response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents. However, these markers are far from perfect, and there is a clinical interest in the search for new biomarkers predictive of the benefit of these therapies beyond PD-L1 and TMB levels.\nPD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors are closely related to CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) inhibitors, such as ipilimumab. PD-1 and CTLA-4 are both expressed on activated T cells, but at different phases of immune response.\nCurrent clinical trials are evaluating anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 drugs in combination with other immunotherapy drugs blocking LAG3, B7-H3, KIR, OX40, PARP, CD27, and ICOS.\n\n\n== Therapeutics ==\n\n\n=== PD-1 ===\nPembrolizumab (Keytruda, formerly MK-3475 and lambrolizumab) was developed by Merck and first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2014 for the treatment of melanoma. It was later approved for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. In 2017, it became the first immunotherapy drug approved for use based on the genetic mutations of the tumor rather than the site of the tumor. It was shown that patients with higher non-synonymous mutation burden in their tumors respond better to the treatment. Both their objective response rate and progression-free survival was shown to be higher than in patients with low non-synonymous mutation burden.\nNivolumab (Opdivo) was developed by",

        "page_content": "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or non-small-cell lung carcinoma, is any type of epithelial lung cancer other than small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC accounts for about 85% of all lung cancers. As a class, NSCLCs are relatively insensitive to chemotherapy, compared to small-cell carcinoma. When possible, they are primarily treated by surgical resection with curative intent, although chemotherapy has been used increasingly both preoperatively (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) and postoperatively (adjuvant chemotherapy).\n\n\n== Types ==\n\nThe most common types of NSCLC are squamous-cell carcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma, but several other types occur less frequently. A few of the less common types are pleomorphic, carcinoid tumor, salivary gland carcinoma, and unclassified carcinoma. All types can occur in unusual histologic variants and as mixed cell-type combinations. Non-squamous-cell carcinoma almost occupies the half of NSCLC. In the tissue classification, the central type contains about one-ninth.\nSometimes, the phrase \"not otherwise specified\" (NOS) is used generically, usually when a more specific diagnosis cannot be made. This is most often the case when a pathologist examines a small number of malignant cells or tissue in a cytology or biopsy specimen.\nLung cancer in people who have never smoked is almost universally NSCLC, with a sizeable majority being adenocarcinoma.\nOn relatively rare occasions, malignant lung tumors are found to contain components of both SCLC and NSCLC. In these cases, the tumors are classified as combined small-cell lung carcinoma (c-SCLC), and are (usually) treated as \"pure\" SCLC.\n\n\n=== Lung adenocarcinoma ===\n\nAdenocarcinoma of the lung is currently the most common type of lung cancer in \"never smokers\" (lifelong nonsmokers). Adenocarcinomas account for about 40% of lung cancers. Historically, adenocarcinoma was more often seen peripherally in the lungs than SCLC and squamous-cell lung cancer, both of which tended to be more often centrally located. Recent studies, though, suggest that the \"ratio of centrally to peripherally occurring\" lesions may be converging toward unity for both adenocarcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.\n\n\n=== Squamous-cell lung carcinoma ===\n\nSquamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung is more common in men than in women. It is closely correlated with a history of tobacco smoking, more so than most other types of lung cancer. According to the Nurses' Health Study, the relative risk of SCC is around 5.5, both among those with a previous duration of smoking of 1 to 20 years and those with 20 to 30 years, compared to \"never smokers\" (lifelong nonsmokers). The relative risk increases to about 16 with a previous smoking duration of 30 to 40 years and roughly 22 with more than 40 years.\n\n\n=== Large-cell lung carcinoma ===\n\nLarge-cell lung carcinoma (LCLC) is a heterogeneous group of undifferentiated malignant neoplasms originating from transformed epithelial cells in the lung. LCLCs have typically comprised around 10% of all NSCLCs in the past, although newer diagnostic techniques seem to be reducing the incidence of diagnosis of \"classic\" LCLC in favor of more poorly differentiated SCCs and adenocarcinomas. LCLC is, in effect, a \"diagnosis of exclusion\", in that the tumor cells lack light microscopic characteristics that would classify the neoplasm as a small-cell carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or another more specific histologic type of lung cancer. LCLC is differentiated from SCLC primarily by the larger size of the anaplastic cells, a higher cytoplasmic-to-nuclear size ratio, and a lack of \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nMany of the symptoms of NSCLC can be signs of other diseases, but having chronic or overlapping symptoms may be a signal of the presence of the disease. Some symptoms are indicators of less advanced cases, while some may signal that the cancer has spread. Some of the symptoms of less advanced cancer ",

Complications can relate to hormonal dysfunction of the kidneys and include (in chronological order) high blood pressure (often related to activation of the renin–angiotensin system), bone disease, and anemia. Additionally CKD patients have markedly increased cardiovascular complications with increased risks of death and hospitalization. CKD can lead to end-stage kidney failure requiring kidney dialysis or kidney transplantation.\nCauses of chronic kidney disease include diabetes, high blood pressure, glomerulonephritis, and polycystic kidney disease. Risk factors include a family history of chronic kidney disease. Diagnosis is by blood tests to measure the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and a urine test to measure albumin. Ultrasound or kidney biopsy may be performed to determine the underlying cause. Several severity-based staging systems are in use.\nTesting people with risk factors (case-finding) is recommended. Initial treatments may include medications to lower blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) are generally first-line agents for blood pressure control, as they slow progression of the kidney disease and the risk of heart disease.

Peripheral artery disease most commonly affects the legs, but other arteries may also be involved, such as those of the arms, neck, or kidneys.\nPeripheral artery disease (PAD) is a form of peripheral vascular disease. Vascular refers to the arteries and veins within the body. PAD differs from peripheral veinous disease. PAD means the arteries are narrowed or blocked—the vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood as it moves from the heart to other parts of the body. Peripheral veinous disease, on the other hand, refers to problems with veins—the vessels that bring the blood back to the heart.\nThe classic symptom is leg pain when walking, which resolves with rest and is known as intermittent claudication. Other symptoms include skin ulcers, bluish skin, cold skin, or abnormal nail and hair growth in the affected leg. Complications may include an infection or tissue death, which may require amputation; coronary artery disease; or stroke. Up to 50% of people with PAD do not have symptoms.\nThe greatest risk factor for PAD is cigarette smoking. Other risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney problems, and high blood cholesterol. PAD is primarily caused by the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries, which is called atherosclerosis, especially in individuals over 40 years old. Other mechanisms include artery spasm, blood clots, trauma, fibromuscular dysplasia, and vasculitis. PAD is typically diagnosed by finding an ankle-brachial index (ABI) less than 0.90, which is the systolic blood pressure at the ankle divided by the systolic blood pressure of the arm. Duplex ultrasonography and angiography may also be used. Angiography is more accurate and allows for treatment at the same time; however, it is associated with greater risks.\nIt is unclear if screening for peripheral artery disease in people without symptoms is useful, as it has not been properly studied. For those with intermittent claudication from PAD, stopping smoking and supervised exercise therapy may improve outcomes. Medications, including statins, ACE inhibitors, and cilostazol, may also help. Aspirin, which helps with thinning the blood and thus improving blood flow, does not appear to help those with mild disease but is usually recommended for those with more significant disease due to the increased risk of heart attacks. Anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as warfarin show no definitive scientific evidence of benefit in PAD. Surgical procedures used to treat PAD include bypass grafting, angioplasty, and atherectomy.\nIn 2015, about 155 million people had PAD worldwide. It becomes more common with age. In the developed world, it affects about 5.3% of 45- to 50-year-olds and 18.6% of 85- to 90-year-olds. In the developing world, it affects 4.6% of people between the ages of 45 and 50 and 15% of people between the ages of 85 and 90. PAD in the developed world is equally common among men and women, though in the developing world, women are more commonly affected.

        "page_content": "Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a type of chronic liver disease. \nThis condition is diagnosed when there is excessive fat build-up in the liver (hepatic steatosis), and at least one metabolic risk factor. When there is also increased alcohol intake, the term MetALD, or metabolic dysfunction and alcohol associated/related liver disease is used, and differentiated from alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) where alcohol is the predominant cause of the steatotic liver disease.  The terms non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, now MASH) have been used to describe different severities, the latter indicating the presence of further liver inflammation. NAFL is less dangerous than NASH and usually does not progress to it, but this progression may eventually lead to complications, such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver failure, and cardiovascular disease.\nObesity and type 2 diabetes are strong risk factors for MASLD. Other risks include being overweight, metabolic syndrome (defined as at least three of the five following medical conditions: abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high serum triglycerides, and low serum HDL cholesterol), a diet high in fructose, and older age. Obtaining a sample of the liver after excluding other potential causes of fatty liver can confirm the diagnosis.\nTreatment for MASLD is weight loss by dietary changes and exercise; bariatric surgery can improve or resolve severe cases. There is some evidence for SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, pioglitazone, vitamin E and milk thistle in the treatment of MASLD. In March 2024, resmetirom was the first drug approved by the FDA for MASH. Those with MASH have a 2.6% increased risk of dying per year.\nMASLD is the most common liver disorder in the world; about 25% of people have it. It is very common in developed nations, such as the United States, and affected about 75 to 100 million Americans in 2017. Over 90% of obese, 60% of diabetic, and up to 20% of normal-weight people develop MASLD. MASLD was the leading cause of chronic liver disease and the second most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States and Europe in 2017. MASLD affects about 20 to 25% of people in Europe. In the United States, estimates suggest that 30% to 40% of adults have MASLD, and about 3% to 12% of adults have MASH. The annual economic burden was about US$103 billion in the United States in 2016.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nAn abnormal accumulation of fat in the liver in the absence of secondary causes of fatty liver, such as significant alcohol use, viral hepatitis, or medications that can induce fatty liver, was the definition of NAFLD.  However, the term MASLD accepts there may be other conditions present, but focuses on the metabolic abnormalities contributing to the disorder. MASLD encompasses a continuum of liver abnormalities, from metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver (MASL, simple steatosis) to Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). These diseases begin with fatty accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis). A liver can remain fatty without disturbing liver function (MASL), but by various mechanisms and possible insults to the liver, it may also progress into steatohepatitis (MASH), a state in which steatosis is combined with inflammation and sometimes fibrosis. MASH can then lead to complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.\nThe new name, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), was proposed after 70% of a panel of experts expressed support for this name.  This new name was adopted in 2023.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n\nPeople with MASLD often have no noticeable symptoms, and it is often only detected during routine blood tests or unrelated abdominal imaging or liver biopsy. In some cases, it can cause symptoms related to liver dysfunction such as fatigue",

NCDs include Parkinson's disease, autoimmune diseases, strokes, heart diseases, cancers, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, cataracts, and others. NCDs may be chronic or acute. Most are non-infectious, although there are some non-communicable infectious diseases, such as parasitic diseases in which the parasite's life cycle does not include direct host-to-host transmission.\nThe four main NCDs that are the leading causes of death globally are cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes. NCDs account for seven out of the ten leading causes of death worldwide. Figures given for 2019 are 41 million deaths due to NCDs worldwide. Of these 17.9 million were due to cardiovascular disease; 9.3 million due to cancer; 4.1 million to chronic respiratory diseases, and 2.0 million to diabetes. Over 80% of the deaths from these four groups were premature, not reaching the age of 70.\nRisk factors such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment increase the likelihood of certain NCDs. Every year, at least 5 million people die because of tobacco use and about 2.8 million die from being overweight. High cholesterol accounts for roughly 2.6 million deaths and 7.5 million die because of high blood pressure.\n\n\n== Risk factors ==\nRisk factors such as a person's background; lifestyle and environment are known to increase the likelihood of certain non-communicable diseases. They include age, gender, genetics, exposure to air pollution, and behaviors such as smoking, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity which can lead to hypertension and obesity, in turn leading to increased risk of many NCDs. Most NCDs are considered preventable because they are caused by modifiable risk factors.\nThe WHO's World Health Report 2002 identified five important risk factors for non-communicable disease in the top ten leading risks to health. These are raised blood pressure, raised cholesterol, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and being overweight. The other factors associated with higher risk of NCDs include a person's economic and social conditions, also known as the social determinants of health.\nIt has been estimated that if the primary risk factors were eliminated, 80% of the cases of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes and 40% of cancers could be prevented. Interventions targeting the main risk factors could have a significant impact on reducing the burden of disease worldwide. Efforts focused on better diet and increased physical activity have been shown to control the prevalence of NCDs .\n\n\n== Environmental diseases ==\nNCDs include many environmental diseases covering a broad category of avoidable and unavoidable human health conditions caused by external factors, such as sunlight, nutrition, pollution, and lifestyle choices. The diseases of affluence are non-infectious diseases with environmental causes. Examples include:\n\nMany types of cardiovascular disease (CVD)\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) caused by smoking tobacco\nDiabetes mellitus type 2\nNoise-induced hearing loss\nLower back pain caused by too little exercise\nMalnutrition caused by too little food, or eating the wrong kinds of food (e.g. scurvy from lack of Vitamin C)\nSkin cancer caused by radiation from the sun\nObesity\n\n\n=== Inherited diseases ===\n\nGenetic disorders are caused by errors in genetic information that produce diseases in the affected people.\nThe origin of these genetic errors can be:\n\nSpontaneous errors or mutations to the genome:\nA change in chromosome numbers, such as Down syndrome.\nA defect in a gene caused by mutation, such as Cystic fibrosis.\nAn increase in the amount of genetic information, such as Chimerism or Heterochromia.\nCystic fibrosis is an example of an inherited disease that is caused by a mutation on a gene.

        "page_content": "A neurodegenerative disease is caused by the progressive loss of neurons, in the process known as neurodegeneration. Neuronal damage may also ultimately result in their death. Neurodegenerative diseases include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple system atrophy, tauopathies, and prion diseases. Neurodegeneration can be found in the brain at many different levels of neuronal circuitry, ranging from molecular to systemic. Because there is no known way to reverse the progressive degeneration of neurons, these diseases are considered to be incurable; however research has shown that the two major contributing factors to neurodegeneration are oxidative stress and inflammation. Biomedical research has revealed many similarities between these diseases at the subcellular level, including atypical protein assemblies (like proteinopathy) and induced cell death. These similarities suggest that therapeutic advances against one neurodegenerative disease might ameliorate other diseases as well.\nWithin neurodegenerative diseases, it is estimated that 55 million people worldwide had dementia in 2019, and that by 2050 this figure will increase to 139 million people.\n\n\n== Specific disorders ==\nThe consequences of neurodegeneration can vary widely depending on the specific region affected, ranging from issues related to movement to the development of dementia.\n\n\n=== Alzheimer's disease ===\n\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that results in the loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical structures, resulting in gross atrophy of the temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and parts of the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. It is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Even with billions of dollars being used to find a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, no effective treatments have been found. Within clinical trials stable and effective AD therapeutic strategies have a 99.5% failure rate.  Reasons for this failure rate include inappropriate drug doses, invalid target and participant selection, and inadequate knowledge of pathophysiology of AD. Currently, diagnoses of Alzheimer's is subpar, and better methods need to be utilized for various aspects of clinical diagnoses. Alzheimer's has a 20% misdiagnosis rate.\nAD pathology is primarily characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Plaques are made up of small peptides, typically 39–43 amino acids in length, called amyloid beta (also written as A-beta or Aβ). Amyloid beta is a fragment from a larger protein called amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP appears to play roles in normal neuron growth, survival and post-injury repair. APP is cleaved into smaller fragments by enzymes such as gamma secretase and beta secretase. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of amyloid beta which can self-assemble into the dense extracellular amyloid plaques.\n\n\n=== Parkinson's disease ===\n\nParkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. It typically manifests as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and posture instability. The crude prevalence rate of PD has been reported to range from 15 per 100,000 to 12,500 per 100,000, and the incidence of PD from 15 per 100,000 to 328 per 100,000, with the disease being less common in Asian countries.\nPD is primarily characterized by death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. The cause of this selective cell death is unknown. Notably, alpha-synuclein-ubiquitin complexes and aggregates are observed to accumulate in Lewy bodies within affected neurons. It is thought that defects in protein transport machinery and regulation, such as RAB1, may play a role in this disease mechanism. Impaired axonal transport of alpha-synuclein may also lead to its accumulation in ",

The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events. As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, self-neglect, and behavioral issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to twelve years.\nThe causes of Alzheimer's disease remain poorly understood. There are many environmental and genetic risk factors associated with its development. The strongest genetic risk factor is from an allele of apolipoprotein E. Other risk factors include a history of head injury, clinical depression, and high blood pressure. The progression of the disease is largely characterised by the accumulation of malformed protein deposits in the cerebral cortex, called amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. These misfolded protein aggregates interfere with normal cell function, and over time lead to irreversible degeneration of neurons and loss of synaptic connections in the brain. A probable diagnosis is based on the history of the illness and cognitive testing, with medical imaging and blood tests to rule out other possible causes. Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal brain aging. Examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis, but this can only take place after death.\nNo treatments can stop or reverse its progression, though some may temporarily improve symptoms. A healthy diet, physical activity, and social engagement are generally beneficial in aging, and may help in reducing the risk of cognitive decline and Alzheimer's. Affected people become increasingly reliant on others for assistance, often placing a burden on caregivers. The pressures can include social, psychological, physical, and economic elements. Exercise programs may be beneficial with respect to activities of daily living and can potentially improve outcomes. Behavioral problems or psychosis due to dementia are sometimes treated with antipsychotics, but this has an increased risk of early death.\nAs of 2020, there were approximately 50 million people worldwide with Alzheimer's disease. It most often begins in people over 65 years of age, although up to 10% of cases are early-onset impacting those in their 30s to mid-60s. It affects about 6% of people 65 years and older, and women more often than men. The disease is named after German psychiatrist and pathologist Alois Alzheimer, who first described it in 1906. Alzheimer's financial burden on society is large, with an estimated global annual cost of US$1 trillion. It is ranked as the seventh leading cause of death worldwide. \nGiven the widespread impacts of Alzheimer's disease, both basic-science and health funders in many countries support Alzheimer's research at large scales.

        "page_content": "Parkinson's disease (PD), or simply Parkinson's, is a neurodegenerative disease primarily of the central nervous system, affecting both motor and non-motor systems. Symptoms typically develop gradually and non-motor issues become more prevalent as the disease progresses. The motor symptoms are collectively called parkinsonism and include tremors, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability (i.e., difficulty maintaining balance). Non-motor symptoms develop later in the disease and include behavioral changes or neuropsychiatric problems, such as sleep abnormalities, psychosis, anosmia, and mood swings.\nMost Parkinson's disease cases are idiopathic, though contributing factors have been identified. Pathophysiology involves progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the substantia nigra, a midbrain region that provides dopamine to the basal ganglia, a system involved in voluntary motor control. The cause of this cell death is poorly understood, but involves the aggregation of alpha-synuclein into Lewy bodies within neurons. Other potential factors involve genetic and environmental influences, medications, lifestyle, and prior health conditions.\nDiagnosis is primarily based on signs and symptoms, typically motor-related, identified through neurological examination. Medical imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography can support the diagnosis. PD typically manifests in individuals over 60, with about one percent affected. In those younger than 50, it is termed \"early-onset PD\".\nNo cure for PD is known, and treatment focuses on alleviating symptoms. Initial treatment typically includes levodopa, MAO-B inhibitors, or dopamine agonists. As the disease progresses, these medications become less effective and may cause involuntary muscle movements. Diet and rehabilitation therapies can help improve symptoms. Deep brain stimulation is used to manage severe motor symptoms when drugs are ineffective. Little evidence exists for treatments addressing non-motor symptoms, such as sleep disturbances and mood instability. Life expectancy for those with PD is near-normal, but is decreased for early-onset.\n\n\n== Classification and terminology ==\n\nParkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems, characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain. It is classified as a synucleinopathy due to the abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein, which aggregates into Lewy bodies within affected neurons.\nThe loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra causes movement abnormalities, leading to Parkinson's further categorization as a movement disorder. In 30% of cases, disease progression leads to the cognitive decline, resulting in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Alongside dementia with Lewy bodies, PDD is one of the two subtypes of Lewy body dementia.\nThe four cardinal motor symptoms of Parkinson's—bradykinesia (slowed movements), postural instability, rigidity, and tremor—are called parkinsonism. These four symptoms are not exclusive to Parkinson's and can occur in many other conditions, including HIV infection and recreational drug use. Neurodegenerative diseases that feature parkinsonism, but have distinct differences are grouped under the umbrella of Parkinson-plus syndromes, or alternatively, atypical parkinsonian disorders. PD can be attributed to genetic factors, but most cases are idiopathic, with no clearly identifiable cause.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\n\n\n=== Motor ===\n\nA wide spectrum of motor and non-motor symptoms appears in PD; the cardinal features are tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability, collectively termed parkinsonism. Appearing in 70–75% of those with PD, tremor is often the predominant motor symptom. Resting tremor is the most common, but kinetic tremors—occurring during voluntary movements—and postural tremor—preventing upright, stable posture—also occur. Tremor",

        "page_content": "Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is a tick-borne disease caused by species of Borrelia bacteria, transmitted by blood-feeding ticks in the genus Ixodes. It is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. Infections are most common in the spring and early summer.  \nThe most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash, known as erythema migrans (EM), which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterwards. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 70–80% of infected people develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headaches and tiredness. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness or heart palpitations. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop.\nDiagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure, and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. If an infection develops, several antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime. Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. People with persistent symptoms after appropriate treatments are said to have Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS).\nPrevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites by wearing clothing to cover the arms and legs and using DEET or picaridin-based insect repellents. As of 2023, clinical trials of proposed human vaccines for Lyme disease were being carried out, but no vaccine was available. A vaccine, LYMERix, was produced but discontinued in 2002 due to insufficient demand. There are several vaccines for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs.\n\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nLyme disease can produce a broad range of symptoms.\n\nThe incubation period is usually one to two weeks, but can be much shorter (days) or much longer (months to years). Lyme symptoms most often occur from May to September in the Northern Hemisphere because the nymphal stage of the tick is responsible for most cases.\n\n\n=== Early localized infection ===\nApproximately 80% of Lyme infections begin with a rash of some sort at the site of a tick bite, often near skin folds such as the armpit, groin, back of the knee, or the trunk under clothing straps, or in children's hair, ears, or neck. Most people who get infected do not remember seeing a tick or a bite. The rash appears typically one or two weeks (range 3–32 days) after the bite and expands 2–3 cm (around 1 inch) per day up to a diameter of 5–70 cm (2 to 28 inches) (median is 16 cm; 6 inches).\nThe rash is usually circular or oval, red or bluish, and may have an elevated or darker center. This rash is termed an erythema migrans (EM), which translates as \"migrating redness.\" In approximately 79% of cases in Europe, this rash gradually clears from the center toward the edges, possibly forming a \"bull's eye\" or \"target-like\" pattern. This clearing only happens in 19% of cases in endemic areas of the United States. The rash may feel warm, usually is not itchy, is rarely tender or painful, and takes up to four weeks to resolve if untreated.\nThe Lyme rash is often accompanied by symptoms of a flu-like illness, including fatigue, headache, body aches, fever, and chills [though usually neither nausea nor upper-respiratory problems]. These symptoms may also appear without a rash or linger after the rash has disappeared. Lyme can progress to later stages without a rash or these symptoms.\nPeople with high fever for more than two days or whose other symptoms of viral-like illness do not improve despite antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, or who have abnormally low levels of white or red cells or platelets in the blood, should be investigated for possible coinfection with other tick-borne diseases such as ehrlichiosis and babesiosis.\nNot everyone with Lyme disease has all the symptoms.",

Clinical trials generate data on dosage, safety and efficacy. They are conducted only after they have received health authority/ethics committee approval in the country where approval of the therapy is sought. These authorities are responsible for vetting the risk/benefit ratio of the trial—their approval does not mean the therapy is 'safe' or effective, only that the trial may be conducted.\nDepending on product type and development stage, investigators initially enroll volunteers or patients into small pilot studies, and subsequently conduct progressively larger scale comparative studies. Clinical trials can vary in size and cost, and they can involve a single research center or multiple centers, in one country or in multiple countries. Clinical study design aims to ensure the scientific validity and reproducibility of the results.\nCosts for clinical trials can range into the billions of dollars per approved drug, and the complete trial process to approval may require 7–15 years. The sponsor may be a governmental organization or a pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical-device company. Certain functions necessary to the trial, such as monitoring and lab work, may be managed by an outsourced partner, such as a contract research organization or a central laboratory. Only 10 percent of all drugs started in human clinical trials become approved drugs.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\n\n=== Trials of drugs ===\nSome clinical trials involve healthy subjects with no pre-existing medical conditions. Other clinical trials pertain to people with specific health conditions who are willing to try an experimental treatment. Pilot experiments are conducted to gain insights for design of the clinical trial to follow.\nThere are two goals to testing medical treatments: to learn whether they work well enough, called \"efficacy\", or \"effectiveness\"; and to learn whether they are safe enough, called \"safety\". Neither is an absolute criterion; both safety and efficacy are evaluated relative to how the treatment is intended to be used, what other treatments are available, and the severity of the disease or condition. The benefits must outweigh the risks. For example, many drugs to treat cancer have severe side effects that would not be acceptable for an over-the-counter pain medication, yet the cancer drugs have been approved since they are used under a physician's care and are used for a life-threatening condition.\nIn the US the elderly constitute 14% of the population, while they consume over one-third of drugs. People over 55 (or a similar cutoff age) are often excluded from trials because their greater health issues and drug use complicate data interpretation, and because they have different physiological capacity than younger people. Children and people with unrelated medical conditions are also frequently excluded. Pregnant women are often excluded due to potential risks to the fetus.\nThe sponsor designs the trial in coordination with a panel of expert clinical investigators, including what alternative or existing treatments to compare to the new drug and what type(s) of patients might benefit. If the sponsor cannot obtain enough test subjects at one location investigators at other locations are recruited to join the study.\nDuring the trial, investigators recruit subjects with the predetermined characteristics, administer the treatment(s) and collect data on the subjects' health for a defined time period. Data include measurements such as vital signs, concentration of the study drug in the blood or tissues, changes to symptoms, and whether improvement or worsening of the condition targeted by the study",

        "page_content": "A randomized controlled trial (or randomized control trial; RCT) is a form of scientific experiment used to control factors not under direct experimental control. Examples of RCTs are clinical trials that compare the effects of drugs, surgical techniques, medical devices, diagnostic procedures, diets or other medical treatments.\nParticipants who enroll in RCTs differ from one another in known and unknown ways that can influence study outcomes, and yet cannot be directly controlled. By randomly allocating participants among compared treatments, an RCT enables statistical control over these influences. Provided it is designed well, conducted properly, and enrolls enough participants, an RCT may achieve sufficient control over these confounding factors to deliver a useful comparison of the treatments studied.\n\n\n== Definition and examples ==\nAn RCT in clinical research typically compares a proposed new treatment against an existing standard of care; these are then termed the 'experimental' and 'control' treatments, respectively. When no such generally accepted treatment is available, a placebo may be used in the control group so that participants are blinded, or not given information, about their treatment allocations. This blinding principle is ideally also extended as much as possible to other parties including researchers, technicians, data analysts, and evaluators. Effective blinding experimentally isolates the physiological effects of treatments from various psychological sources of bias.\nThe randomness in the assignment of participants to treatments reduces selection bias and allocation bias, balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments. Blinding reduces other forms of experimenter and subject biases.\nA well-blinded RCT is considered the gold standard for clinical trials. Blinded RCTs are commonly used to test the efficacy of medical interventions and may additionally provide information about adverse effects, such as drug reactions. A randomized controlled trial can provide compelling evidence that the study treatment causes an effect on human health.\nThe terms \"RCT\" and \"randomized trial\" are sometimes used synonymously, but the latter term omits mention of controls and can therefore describe studies that compare multiple treatment groups with each other in the absence of a control group. Similarly, the initialism is sometimes expanded as \"randomized clinical trial\" or \"randomized comparative trial\", leading to ambiguity in the scientific literature. Not all RCTs are randomized controlled trials (and some of them could never be, as in cases where controls would be impractical or unethical to use). The term randomized controlled clinical trial is an alternative term used in clinical research; however, RCTs are also employed in other research areas, including many of the social sciences.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first reported clinical trial was conducted by James Lind in 1747 to identify a treatment for scurvy. The first blind experiment was conducted by the French Royal Commission on Animal Magnetism in 1784 to investigate the claims of mesmerism. An early essay advocating the blinding of researchers came from Claude Bernard in the latter half of the 19th century. Bernard recommended that the observer of an experiment should not have knowledge of the hypothesis being tested. This suggestion contrasted starkly with the prevalent Enlightenment-era attitude that scientific observation can only be objectively valid when undertaken by a well-educated, informed scientist. The first study recorded to have a blinded researcher was published in 1907 by W. H. R. Rivers and H. N. Webber to investigate the effects of caffeine.\nRandomized experiments first appeared in psychology, where they were introduced by Charles Sanders Peirce and Joseph Jastrow in the 1880s, and in education. The earliest experiments comparing treatment and control groups were published by Robert Woodworth and Edward Thorndike i",

Clinical trial registration is similar, although it may not require the registration of a study's analysis protocol. Finally, registered reports include the peer review and in principle acceptance of a study protocol prior to data collection.\nPreregistration has the goal to transparently evaluate the severity of hypothesis tests, and can have a number of secondary goals  (which can also be achieved without preregistering ), including (a) facilitating and documenting research plans, (b) identifying and reducing questionable research practices and researcher biases, (c) distinguishing between confirmatory and exploratory analyses, and, in the case of Registered Reports, (d) facilitating results-blind peer review, and (e) reducing publication bias. \nAlthough the idea of preregistration is old, the practice of preregistering studies has gained prominence to mitigate certain issues that contribute to the replication crisis in scientific studies. Among others, these issues include publication bias and questionable research practices, such as p-hacking and HARKing.\n\n\n== Types ==\n\n\n=== Standard preregistration ===\nIn the standard preregistration format, researchers prepare a research protocol document prior to conducting their research. Ideally, this document indicates the research hypotheses, sampling procedure, sample size, research design, testing conditions, stimuli, measures, data coding and aggregation method, criteria for data exclusions, and statistical analyses, including potential variations on those analyses. This preregistration document is then posted on a publicly available website such as the Open Science Framework or AsPredicted. The preregistered study is then conducted, and a report of the study and its results are submitted for publication together with access to the preregistration document. This preregistration approach allows peer reviewers and subsequent readers to cross-reference the preregistration document with the published research article in order to identify the presence of any opportunistic deviations of the preregistration that reduce the severity of tests. Deviations from the preregistration are possible and common in practice, but they should be transparently reported, and the consequences for the severity of the test should be evaluated.\n\n\n=== Registered reports ===\nThe registered report format requires authors to submit a description of the study methods and analyses prior to data collection. Once the theoretical introduction, method, and analysis plan has been peer reviewed (Stage 1 peer review), publication of the findings is provisionally guaranteed (in principle acceptance). The proposed study is then performed, and the research report is submitted for Stage 2 peer review. Stage 2 peer review confirms that the actual research methods are consistent with the preregistered protocol, that quality thresholds are met (e.g., manipulation checks confirm the validity of the experimental manipulation), and that the conclusions follow from the data. Because studies are accepted for publication regardless of whether the results are statistically significant Registered Reports prevent publication bias. Meta-scientific research has shown that the percentage of non-significant results in Registered Reports is substantially higher than in standard publications.\n\n\n=== Specialized preregistration ===\nPreregistration can be used in relation to a variety of different research designs and methods, including:\n\nQuantitative research in psychology\nQualitative research\nPreexisting data\nSingle case designs\nElectroencephalogram research\nExperience sampling\nExploratory research\nAnimal Research\n\n\n== Clinical trial registration ==\nClinical trial registration is the practice of documenting clinical trials before they are performed in a clinical trials registry so as to combat publication bias and ",

        "page_content": "Pharmacokinetics (from Ancient Greek pharmakon \"drug\" and kinetikos \"moving, putting in motion\"; see chemical kinetics), sometimes abbreviated as PK,  is a branch of pharmacology dedicated to describing how the body affects a specific substance after administration. The substances of interest include any chemical xenobiotic such as pharmaceutical drugs, pesticides, food additives, cosmetics, etc. It attempts to analyze chemical metabolism and to discover the fate of a chemical from the moment that it is administered up to the point at which it is completely eliminated from the body. Pharmacokinetics is based on mathematical modeling that places great emphasis on the relationship between drug plasma concentration and the time elapsed since the drug's administration. Pharmacokinetics is the study of how an organism affects the drug, whereas pharmacodynamics (PD) is the study of how the drug affects the organism. Both together influence dosing, benefit, and adverse effects, as seen in PK/PD models.\n\n\n== ADME ==\n\nA number of phases occur once the drug enters into contact with the organism, these are described using the acronym ADME (or LADME if liberation is included as a separate step from absorption):\n\nLiberation – the process of the active ingredient separating from its pharmaceutical formulation. See also IVIVC.\nAbsorption – the process of a drug entering into systemic circulation from the site of administration\nDistribution – the dispersion or dissemination of substances throughout the fluids and tissues of the body.\nMetabolism (or biotransformation, or inactivation) – the chemical reactions of the drug and irreversible breakdown into metabolites (e.g. by metabolic enzymes such as cytochrome P450 or glucuronosyltransferase enzymes)\nExcretion – the removal of the substance or metabolites from the body. In rare cases, some drugs irreversibly accumulate in body tissue. \nSome textbooks combine the first two phases as the drug is often administered in an active form, which means that there is no liberation phase. Others include a phase that combines distribution, metabolism and excretion into a disposition phase. Other authors include the drug's toxicological aspect in what is known as ADME-Tox or ADMET. The two phases of metabolism and excretion can be grouped together under the title elimination.\nThe study of these distinct phases involves the use and manipulation of basic concepts in order to understand the process dynamics. For this reason, in order to fully comprehend the kinetics of a drug it is necessary to have detailed knowledge of a number of factors such as: the properties of the substances that act as excipients, the characteristics of the appropriate biological membranes and the way that substances can cross them, or the characteristics of the enzyme reactions that inactivate the drug.\n\n\n== Metrics ==\nThe following are the most commonly measured pharmacokinetic metrics: The units of the dose in the table are expressed in moles (mol) and molar (M). To express the metrics of the table in units of mass, instead of Amount of substance, simply replace 'mol' with 'g' and 'M' with 'g/L'. Similarly, other units in the table may be expressed in units of an equivalent dimension by scaling.\n\nIn pharmacokinetics, steady state refers to the situation where the overall intake of a drug is fairly in dynamic equilibrium with its elimination. In practice, it is generally considered that once regular dosing of a drug is started, steady state is reached after 3 to 5 times its half-life. In steady state and in linear pharmacokinetics, AUCτ=AUC∞.\n\n\n== Modeling ==\nModels have been developed to simplify conceptualization of the many processes that take place in the interaction between an organism and a chemical substance. Pharmacokinetic modelling may be performed either by noncompartmental or compartmental methods. Multi-compartment models provide the best approximations to reality; however, the complexity involved in adding parameters wit",

        "page_content": "The pharmacology of testosterone, an androgen and anabolic steroid (AAS) medication and naturally occurring steroid hormone, concerns its pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and various routes of administration.\nTestosterone is a naturally occurring and bioidentical AAS, or an agonist of the androgen receptor, the biological target of androgens like endogenous testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).\nTestosterone is used by both men and women and can be taken by a variety of different routes of administration.\n\n\n== Routes of administration ==\n\nTestosterone can be taken by a variety of different routes of administration. These include oral, buccal, sublingual, intranasal, transdermal (gels, creams, patches, solutions), vaginal (creams, gels, suppositories), rectal (suppositories), by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection (in oil solutions or aqueous suspensions), and as a subcutaneous implant. The pharmacokinetics of testosterone, including its bioavailability, metabolism, biological half-life, and other parameters, differ by route of administration. Likewise, the potency of testosterone, and its local effects in certain tissues, for instance the liver, differ by route of administration as well. In particular, the oral route is subject to a high first-pass effect, which results in high levels of testosterone in the liver and consequent hepatic androgenic effects, as well as low potency due to first-pass metabolism in the intestines and liver into metabolites like dihydrotestosterone and androgen conjugates. Conversely, this is not the case for non-oral routes, which bypass the first pass.\nDifferent testosterone routes and dosages can achieve widely varying circulating testosterone levels. For purposes of comparison with normal physiological circumstances, circulating levels of total testosterone in men range from about 250 to 1,100 ng/dL (mean 630 ng/dL) and in women range from about 2 to 50 ng/dL (mean 32 ng/dL). Testosterone levels decline with age in men. In women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition of androgen excess, testosterone levels are typically around 50 to 80 ng/dL, with a range of about 30 to 140 ng/dL. Total testosterone levels are about 20-fold and free testosterone levels about 40-fold higher in men than in women on average. Similarly, testosterone production is approximately 30 times higher in men than in women.\n\n\n=== Oral administration ===\n\n\n==== Oral testosterone ====\nTestosterone is well-absorbed but extensively metabolized with oral administration due to the first pass through the intestines and liver. It is rapidly and completely inactivated in men at doses of less than 200 mg. In large doses, such as 200 mg however, significant increases in circulating testosterone levels become apparent. In addition, while a 60 mg dose has no effect on testosterone levels in men, this dose does measurably increase testosterone levels in prepubertal boys and women. The oral bioavailability of testosterone in young women after a single 25 mg dose was found to be 3.6 ± 2.5%. High levels of testosterone are also achieved with a 60 mg dose of oral testosterone in men with liver cirrhosis. These findings are attributed to induction of liver enzymes by testosterone and consequent activation of its own metabolism. Substitution dosages of oral testosterone in men are in the range of 400 to 800 mg/day. Such doses exceed the amount of testosterone produced by the body, which is approximately 7 mg/day, by approximately 100-fold. The elimination half-life of oral testosterone is rapid at about 5 to 7 hours. As a result, it requires administration several times per day in divided doses. Due to its limitations, such as the high doses required and necessity of multiple daily doses, oral testosterone is not used clinically in its unmodified form.\nOral testosterone has been studied in combination with a 5α-reductase inhibitor to reduce its first-pass metabolism and improve its bioavailability.\n\n\n==== Oral testosterone",

        "page_content": "Drug metabolism is the metabolic breakdown of drugs by living organisms, usually through specialized enzymatic systems. More generally, xenobiotic metabolism (from the Greek xenos \"stranger\" and biotic \"related to living beings\") is the set of metabolic pathways that modify the chemical structure of xenobiotics, which are compounds foreign to an organism's normal biochemistry, such as any drug or poison. These pathways are a form of biotransformation present in all major groups of organisms and are considered to be of ancient origin. These reactions often act to detoxify poisonous compounds (although in some cases the intermediates in xenobiotic metabolism can themselves cause toxic effects). The study of drug metabolism is the object of pharmacokinetics. Metabolism is one of the stages (see ADME) of the drug's transit through the body that involves the breakdown of the drug so that it can be excreted by the body.\nThe metabolism of pharmaceutical drugs is an important aspect of pharmacology and medicine. For example, the rate of metabolism determines the duration and intensity of a drug's pharmacologic action. Drug metabolism also affects multidrug resistance in infectious diseases and in chemotherapy for cancer, and the actions of some drugs as substrates or inhibitors of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism are a common reason for hazardous drug interactions. These pathways are also important in environmental science, with the xenobiotic metabolism of microorganisms determining whether a pollutant will be broken down during bioremediation, or persist in the environment. The enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism, particularly the glutathione S-transferases are also important in agriculture, since they may produce resistance to pesticides and herbicides.\nDrug metabolism is divided into three phases. In phase I, enzymes such as Cytochrome P450 oxidases introduce reactive or polar groups into xenobiotics. These modified compounds are then conjugated to polar compounds in phase II reactions. These reactions are catalyzed by transferase enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases. Finally, in phase III, the conjugated xenobiotics may be further processed, before being recognized by efflux transporters and pumped out of cells. Drug metabolism often converts lipophilic compounds into hydrophilic products that are more readily excreted.\n\n\n== Permeability barriers and detoxification ==\nThe exact compounds an organism is exposed to will be largely unpredictable, and may differ widely over time; these are major characteristics of xenobiotic toxic stress. The major challenge faced by xenobiotic detoxification systems is that they must be able to remove the almost-limitless number of xenobiotic compounds from the complex mixture of chemicals involved in normal metabolism. The solution that has evolved to address this problem is an elegant combination of physical barriers and low-specificity enzymatic systems.\nAll organisms use cell membranes as hydrophobic permeability barriers to control access to their internal environment. Polar compounds cannot diffuse across these cell membranes, and the uptake of useful molecules is mediated through transport proteins that specifically select substrates from the extracellular mixture. This selective uptake means that most hydrophilic molecules cannot enter cells, since they are not recognized by any specific transporters. In contrast, the diffusion of hydrophobic compounds across these barriers cannot be controlled, and organisms, therefore, cannot exclude lipid-soluble xenobiotics using membrane barriers.\nHowever, the existence of a permeability barrier means that organisms were able to evolve detoxification systems that exploit the hydrophobicity common to membrane-permeable xenobiotics. These systems therefore solve the specificity problem by possessing such broad substrate specificities that they metabolize almost any non-polar compound. Useful metabolites are excluded since they are polar, and i",

The effect is most studied with grapefruit and grapefruit juice, but similar effects have been observed with certain other citrus fruits.\nOne whole grapefruit, or a small glass (200 mL, 6.8 US fl oz) of grapefruit juice, can cause drug overdose toxicity in patients taking felodipine. Fruit consumed three days before the medicine can still have an effect. The relative risks of different types of citrus fruit have not been systematically studied. Affected drugs typically have an auxiliary label saying \"Do not take with grapefruit\" on the container, and the interaction is elaborated upon in the package insert. People are advised to ask their physician or pharmacist about drug interactions. However, some experts believe that for the majority of patients, complete avoidance of grapefruit is unwarranted.\nAlthough a prospective cohort study of middle-aged women indicated that some flavonoid-rich foods are associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality, frequent grapefruit consumption was associated with a small increase in all-cause mortality, possibly because of the clinically significant drug interactions of the non-flavonoid components.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe effect of grapefruit juice with regard to drug absorption was originally discovered in 1989 by a group led by pharmacologist David Bailey. Their first published clinical report on grapefruit drug interactions was in 1991. The effect was first discovered accidentally in 1989, when a test of drug interactions with alcohol used grapefruit juice to hide the taste of the ethanol. A 2005 medical review advised patients to avoid all citrus juices until further research clarifies the risks. It was reported in 2008 that similar effects had been observed with apple juice.\n\n\n== Polyphenols ==\nCitrus fruits contain various polyphenols, which may include furanocoumarins and naringin, such as bergamottin, dihydroxybergamottin, and bergapten. Grapefruit, Seville oranges, and bergamot contain naringin. Furanocoumarins may have a stronger effect than naringin.\n\n\n== Mechanism ==\nThe effects are caused by furanocoumarins (and, to a lesser extent, flavonoids) which are compounds produced by many plants including but not limited to grapefruit. These chemicals inhibit key drug metabolizing enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). CYP3A4 is a metabolizing enzyme for almost 50% of drugs, and is found in the liver and small intestinal epithelial cells. Organic derivatives of furanocoumarin interfere with liver and intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 and may be responsible for the effects of grapefruit on the enzyme. Cytochrome isoforms affected by grapefruit components include CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, but CYP3A4 is the major CYP enzyme in the intestine.\nInhibition of enzymes can have two different effects:\n\ngrapefruit juice-mediated inhibition of enzymes that metabolize the drug to an inactive metabolite leads to too high doses of the drug in the body\ngrapefruit juice-mediated inhibition of membrane transport proteins from the intestine to the blood, or inhibition of enzymes that activates a prodrug to an active metabolite leads to insufficient doses of the drug in the body resulting in loss of theurapeutic effect\nGrapefruit or grapefruit juice can reduce the absorption of many drugs by inhibiting transport across cell membranes by the transporters P-glycoprotein (a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters) and members of the organo anion transporter family. These transporters appear to have a minimal effect on systemic exposure of the drugs they affect, however. Many drugs are affected by consumption of citrus juice. When the metabolizing enzyme is inhibited, less of the drug will be metabolized by it in the epithelial cells. This interaction is particularly dangerous when the drug in question has a low therapeutic index, so that a small increase in blood concentration can",

Due to its estrogenic activity, estradiol has antigonadotropic effects and can inhibit fertility and suppress sex hormone production in both women and men. Estradiol differs from non-bioidentical estrogens like conjugated estrogens and ethinylestradiol in various ways, with implications for tolerability and safety.\nEstradiol can be taken by mouth, held under the tongue, as a gel or patch that is applied to the skin, in through the vagina, by injection into muscle or fat, or through the use of an implant that is placed into fat, among other routes.\n\n\n== Routes of administration ==\n\nEstradiol can be taken by a variety of different routes of administration. These include oral, buccal, sublingual, intranasal, transdermal (gels, creams, patches), vaginal (tablets, creams, rings, suppositories), rectal, by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection (in oil or aqueous), and as a subcutaneous implant. The pharmacokinetics of estradiol, including its bioavailability, metabolism, biological half-life, and other parameters, differ by route of administration. Likewise, the potency of estradiol, and its local effects in certain tissues, most importantly the liver, differ by route of administration as well. In particular, the oral route is subject to a high first-pass effect, which results in high levels of estradiol and consequent estrogenic effects in the liver and low potency due to first-pass hepatic and intestinal metabolism into metabolites like estrone and estrogen conjugates. Conversely, this is not the case for parenteral (non-oral) routes, which bypass the intestines and liver.\nDifferent estradiol routes and dosages can achieve widely varying circulating estradiol levels (see the table below). For purposes of comparison with normal physiological circumstances, menstrual cycle circulating levels of estradiol in premenopausal women are 40 pg/mL in the early follicular phase, 250 pg/mL at the middle of the cycle, and 100 pg/mL during the mid-luteal phase. Mean integrated levels of circulating estradiol in premenopausal women across the whole menstrual cycle are in the range of 80 to 150 pg/mL, according to some sources. In postmenopausal women, circulating levels of estradiol are below 15 pg/mL. During normal human pregnancy, estrogen production increases progressively and extremely high estrogen levels are attained. Estradiol levels range from 1,000 to 40,000 pg/mL across pregnancy, are on average 25,000 pg/mL at term, and reach levels as high as 75,000 pg/mL in some women.\n\n\n=== Oral administration ===\n\n\n==== Absorption and bioavailability ====\nThe oral bioavailability of estradiol is very low. This is due to the fact that estradiol is poorly soluble in water, which limits its dissolution and absorption, and is additionally subject to extensive metabolism during the first pass through the intestines and liver. Estradiol is micronized and/or conjugated with an ester, as in estradiol valerate or estradiol acetate, to improve its oral bioavailability and potency. Micronization decreases the particle size of estradiol crystals and hence increases the surface area for absorption, thereby improving the rate and extent of absorption. In addition, there is an improvement in metabolic stability. Oral micronized estradiol consists of more than 80% of estradiol particles micronized to a size smaller than 20 μm in diameter, or to about 1 to 3 μm on average. All oral formulations of estradiol available today are micronized, and oral estradiol valerate tablets also seem to be micronized.\nOral non-micronized estradiol and oral micronized estradiol do not appear to have ever been directly compared in a study.

        "page_content": "The biochemistry of Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia, is not yet very well understood. Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been identified as a proteopathy: a protein misfolding disease due to the accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta (Aβ) protein in the brain. Amyloid beta is a short peptide that is an abnormal proteolytic byproduct of the transmembrane protein amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), whose function is unclear but thought to be involved in neuronal development.  The presenilins are components of proteolytic complex involved in APP processing and degradation.\nAmyloid beta monomers are soluble and contain short regions of beta sheet and polyproline II helix secondary structures in solution, though they are largely alpha helical in membranes; however, at sufficiently high concentration, they undergo a dramatic conformational change to form a beta sheet-rich tertiary structure that aggregates to form amyloid fibrils. These fibrils and oligomeric forms of Aβ deposit outside neurons in formations known as senile plaques. There are different types of plaques, including the diffuse, compact, cored or neuritic plaque types, as well as Aβ deposits in the walls of small blood vessel walls in the brain called cerebral amyloid angiopathy.\nAD is also considered a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein, a microtubule-associated protein expressed in neurons that normally acts to stabilize microtubules in the cell cytoskeleton. Like most microtubule-associated proteins, tau is normally regulated by phosphorylation; however, in Alzheimer's disease, hyperphosphorylated tau accumulates as paired helical filaments that in turn aggregate into masses inside nerve cell bodies known as neurofibrillary tangles and as dystrophic neurites associated with amyloid plaques. Although little is known about the process of filament assembly, depletion of a prolyl isomerase protein in the parvulin family has been shown to accelerate the accumulation of abnormal tau.\nNeuroinflammation is also involved in the complex cascade leading to AD pathology and symptoms. Considerable pathological and clinical evidence documents immunological changes associated with AD, including increased pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Whether these changes may be a cause or consequence of AD remains to be fully understood, but inflammation within the brain, including increased reactivity of the resident microglia towards amyloid deposits, has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of AD. Much of the known biochemistry of Alzheimer's disease has been deciphered through research using experimental models of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\n== Neuropathology ==\nAt a macroscopic level, AD is characterized by loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical regions. This results in gross atrophy of the affected regions, including degeneration in the temporal lobe and parietal lobe, and parts of the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus.\nBoth amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are clearly visible by microscopy in AD brains. Plaques are dense, mostly insoluble deposits of protein and cellular material outside and around neurons. Tangles are insoluble twisted fibers that build up inside the nerve cell. Though many older people develop some plaques and tangles, the brains of AD patients have them to a much greater extent and in different brain locations.\n\n\n== Biochemical characteristics ==\nFundamental to the understanding of Alzheimer's disease is the biochemical events that leads to accumulation of the amyloid-beta plaques and tau-protein tangles. A delicate balance of the enzymes secretases regulate the amyloid-beta accumulation. Recently, a link between cholinergic neuronal activity and the activity of alpha-secretase has been highlighted, which can discourage amyloid-beta proteins deposition in brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.  \nAlzheimer's dis",

It is also a topic of interest in the East Asian population, especially as the burden of disease increases due to aging and population growth. The pathogenesis of AD between ethnic groups is different. However, prior studies in AD pathology have focused primarily on populations of European ancestry and may not give adequate insight on the genetic, clinical, and biological differences found in East Asians with AD. Gaps in knowledge regarding Alzheimer's disease in the East Asian population introduce serious barriers to screening, early prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and timely intervention. == Prevalence == The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is significant in East Asian countries compared to the global average, which has 667 cases per 100,000 people. Japan has the highest prevalence of AD in the world at 3,079 cases per 100,000 population. South Korea and China have 1119 and 924 cases per 100,000 people, respectively. China has the highest number of people with dementia in the world at 13.1 million cases. Women were found to have higher rates of AD, potentially due to higher estrogen levels. According to a study, early menopause could be a contributing factor to an increased risk of AD. The prevalence is higher in older individuals and in rural areas. In North America, the rates of Alzheimer's disease in Asian Americans were found to be similar to Non-Hispanic whites and lower compared to Black Americans and Hispanic Americans. Japanese Americans were found to have increased AD prevalence compared to other Asian American subgroups. In terms of trends, Japan has experienced a rapid increase in prevalence rates relative to the global average, from 772 cases per 100,000 in 1990 to 3029 cases per 100,000 in 2019.

However, lifestyle factors and other co-morbidities can play a significant role in contributing to AD susceptibility. === Demographic risk factors === Older age is a significant risk factor for dementia, with the rate of cognitive decline being tenfold greater in the last three years of life. Income, occupation, and education are associated with the risk of developing AD in East Asian populations. Higher education generally indicates lower risk of AD. More physical or unsafe workplace conditions are associated with increased risk of AD. === Behavioral and physiological risk factors === Smoking, low social activity, and low physical activity are risk factors for AD in East Asian populations. Vascular conditions such as high blood pressure are also linked to dementia later in life. A sedentary lifestyle or obesity are believed to contribute to dementia susceptibility. Specifically, lower body mass index (BMI) may contribute to a lower likelihood of dementia. A healthy diet high in fish, fruit, Vegetables, and legumes but lower in meat and dairy is associated with decreased risk of AD. Regular consumption of vegetable and fruit juices may decrease AD risk due to the intake of popyphenols. Abnormal levels of insulin and impaired glucose tolerance is connected to increased dementia susceptibility in East Asians. Poor early life environmental factors contribute to longer duration or more rapidly progressing AD later in life. Moreover, heavy metal exposures, such as lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic, have been found to induce neurotoxicity, leading to an increased risk of AD. Daytime sleepiness and sleep apnea may have a relationship with later cognitive decline and dementia. A study of Japanese Americans found that mid-life proteinuria and impaired renal function may be an independent predictor of late-life dementia. ===",

The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events. As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, self-neglect, and behavioral issues.

There is currently no cure or approved symptomatic treatment for FTD, although some off-label drugs and behavioral methods are prescribed. Features of FTD were first described by Arnold Pick between 1892 and 1906. The name Pick's disease was coined in 1922. This term is now reserved only for the behavioral variant of FTD, in which characteristic Pick bodies and Pick cells are present. These were first described by Alois Alzheimer in 1911. Common signs and symptoms include significant changes in social and personal behavior, disinhibition, apathy, blunting and dysregulation of emotions, and deficits in both expressive and receptive language. Each FTD subtype is relatively rare. FTDs are mostly early onset syndromes linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), which is characterized by progressive neuronal loss predominantly involving the frontal or temporal lobes, and a typical loss of more than 70% of spindle neurons, while other neuron types remain intact. The three main subtypes or variant syndromes are a behavioral variant (bvFTD) previously known as Pick's disease, and two variants of primary progressive aphasia (PPA): semantic (svPPA) and nonfluent (nfvPPA). Two rare distinct subtypes of FTD are neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease (NIFID) and basophilic inclusion body disease (BIBD). Other related disorders include corticobasal syndrome (CBS or CBD), and FTD with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). == Signs and symptoms == Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is an early onset disorder that mostly occurs between the ages of 45 and 65, but can begin earlier, and in 20–25% of cases onset is later. Men and women appear to be equally affected. It is the most common early presenting dementia. FTD is the second most prevalent type of early onset dementia after Alzheimer's disease. The International Classification of Diseases recognizes the disease as causative to disorders affecting mental and behavioural aspects in humans. Dissociation from family, compulsive buying disorder (oniomania), vulgar speech characteristics, screaming, inability to control emotions, behavior, personality, and temperament are characteristic social display patterns. A gradual onset and progression of changes in behavior or language deficits are reported to have begun several years prior to presentation to a neurologist. ==",

        "page_content": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a type of dementia characterized by changes in sleep, behavior, cognition, movement, and regulation of automatic bodily functions. Unlike some other dementias, memory loss may not be an early symptom. The disease worsens over time and is usually diagnosed when cognitive impairment interferes with normal daily functioning. Together with Parkinson's disease dementia, DLB is one of the two Lewy body dementias. It is a common form of dementia, but the prevalence is not known accurately and many diagnoses are missed. The disease was first described on autopsy by Kenji Kosaka in 1976, and he named the condition several years later. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD)—in which people lose the muscle paralysis (atonia) that normally occurs during REM sleep and act out their dreams—is a core feature. RBD may appear years or decades before other symptoms. Other core features are visual hallucinations, marked fluctuations in attention or alertness, and parkinsonism (slowness of movement, trouble walking, or rigidity). A presumptive diagnosis can be made if several disease features or biomarkers are present; the diagnostic workup may include blood tests, neuropsychological tests, imaging, and sleep studies. A definitive diagnosis usually requires an autopsy. Most people with DLB do not have affected family members, although occasionally DLB runs in a family. The exact cause is unknown but involves formation of abnormal clumps of protein in neurons throughout the brain. Manifesting as Lewy bodies (discovered in 1912 by Frederic Lewy) and Lewy neurites, these clumps affect both the central and the autonomic nervous systems. Heart function and every level of gastrointestinal function—from chewing to defecation—can be affected, constipation being one of the most common symptoms. Low blood pressure upon standing can also occur. DLB commonly causes psychiatric symptoms, such as altered behavior, depression, or apathy. DLB typically begins after the age of fifty, and people with the disease have an average life expectancy, with wide variability, of about four years after diagnosis. There is no cure or medication to stop the disease from progressing, and people in the latter stages of DLB may be unable to care for themselves. Treatments aim to relieve some of the symptoms and reduce the burden on caregivers. Medicines such as donepezil and rivastigmine can temporarily improve cognition and overall functioning, and melatonin can be used for sleep-related symptoms. Antipsychotics are usually avoided, even for hallucinations, because severe reactions occur in almost half of people with DLB, and their use can result in death. Management of the many different symptoms is challenging, as it involves multiple specialties and education of caregivers. ==",

        "page_content": "Cancer immunotherapy (immuno-oncotherapy) is the stimulation of the immune system to treat cancer, improving the immune system's natural ability to fight the disease. It is an application of the fundamental research of cancer immunology (immuno-oncology) and a growing subspecialty of oncology. Cancer immunotherapy exploits the fact that cancer cells often have tumor antigens, molecules on their surface that can bind to antibody proteins or T-cell receptors, triggering an immune system response. The tumor antigens are often proteins or other macromolecules (e.g., carbohydrates). Normal antibodies bind to external pathogens, but the modified immunotherapy antibodies bind to the tumor antigens marking and identifying the cancer cells for the immune system to inhibit or kill. The clinical success of cancer immunotherapy is highly variable between different forms of cancer; for instance, certain subtypes of gastric cancer react well to the approach whereas immunotherapy is not effective for other subtypes. Major types of cancer immunotherapy include immune checkpoint inhibitors, which block inhibitory pathways such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 to enhance T cell activity against tumors. These therapies have shown effectiveness in treating cancers such as melanoma and lung cancer. Adoptive cell therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, involve modifying a patient’s immune cells to recognize cancer-specific antigens. These therapies have been particularly effective in certain blood cancers. Natural killer cell (NK) therapies and CAR-NK cell approaches are also being explored, leveraging NK cells' innate ability to target tumor cells. Other strategies include cancer vaccines, which aim to provoke an immune response against tumor-associated antigens, and may be either preventive or therapeutic. Immunomodulatory agents such as cytokines (e.g., interleukin-2, interferon-alpha) and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) are used to enhance immune activity or alter the tumor microenvironment. Oncolytic virus therapies, which employ engineered viruses to selectively kill cancer cells while promoting systemic immunity, are also under investigation. In 2018, American immunologist James P. Allison and Japanese immunologist Tasuku Honjo received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation. ==",

Immunotherapy is under preliminary research for its potential to treat various forms of cancer. Cell-based immunotherapies are effective for some cancers.

Vaccine-induced immunity to COVID-19 relies mostly on an immunomodulatory T-cell response. Therapies such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferons, imiquimod and cellular membrane fractions from bacteria are licensed for medical use. Others including IL-2, IL-7, IL-12, various chemokines, synthetic cytosine phosphate-guanosine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides and glucans are involved in clinical and preclinical studies. == Immunomodulators == Immunomodulators are the active agents of immunotherapy.

In 2018 the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to James P. Allison and Tasuku Honjo \"for their discovery of cancer therapy by inhibition of negative immune regulation.\" Cancer immunotherapy attempts to stimulate the immune system to destroy tumours. A variety of strategies are in use or are undergoing research and testing. Randomized controlled studies in different cancers resulting in significant increase in survival and disease free period have been reported and its efficacy is enhanced by 20–30% when cell-based immunotherapy is combined with conventional treatment methods. One of the oldest forms of cancer immunotherapy is the use of BCG vaccine, which was originally to vaccinate against tuberculosis and later was found to be useful in the treatment of bladder cancer. BCG immunotherapy induces both local and systemic immune responses. The mechanisms by which BCG immunotherapy mediates tumor immunity have been widely studied, but they are still not completely understood. The use of monoclonal antibodies in cancer therapy was first introduced in 1997 with rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody for treatment of B cell lymphoma. Since then several monoclonal antibodies have been approved for treatment of various haematological malignancies as well as for solid tumours. The extraction of G-CSF lymphocytes from the blood and expanding in vitro against a tumour antigen before reinjecting the cells with appropriate stimulatory cytokines. The cells then destroy the tumour cells that express the antigen. Topical immunotherapy utilizes an immune enhancement cream (imiquimod) which produces interferon, causing the recipient's killer T cells to destroy warts, actinic keratoses, basal cell cancer, vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia, squamous cell cancer, cutaneous lymphoma, and superficial malignant melanoma. Injection immunotherapy (\"intralesional\" or \"intratumoural\") uses mumps, candida, the HPV vaccine or trichophytin antigen injections to treat warts (HPV induced tumours). Adoptive cell transfer has been tested on lung and other cancers, with greatest success achieved in melanoma.",

        "page_content": "Bladder cancer is the abnormal growth of cells in the bladder. These cells can grow to form a tumor, which eventually spreads, damaging the bladder and other organs. Most people with bladder cancer are diagnosed after noticing blood in their urine. Those suspected of having bladder cancer typically have their bladder inspected by a thin medical camera, a procedure called cystoscopy. Suspected tumors are removed and examined to determine if they are cancerous. Based on how far the tumor has spread, the cancer case is assigned a stage 0 to 4; a higher stage indicates a more widespread and dangerous disease. Those whose bladder tumors have not spread outside the bladder have the best prognoses. These tumors are typically surgically removed, and the person is treated with chemotherapy or one of several immune-stimulating therapies. Those whose tumors continue to grow, or whose tumors have penetrated the bladder muscle, often have their bladder surgically removed (radical cystectomy). People whose tumors have spread beyond the bladder have the worst prognoses; on average they survive a year from diagnosis. These people are treated with chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors, followed by enfortumab vedotin. Around 500,000 people are diagnosed with bladder cancer each year, and 200,000 die of the disease. The risk of bladder cancer increases with age and the average age at diagnosis is 73. Tobacco smoking is the greatest contributor to bladder cancer risk, and causes around half of bladder cancer cases. Exposure to certain toxic chemicals or the tropical bladder infection schistosomiasis also increases the risk. == Signs and symptoms == The most common symptom of bladder cancer is visible blood in the urine (haematuria) despite painless urination. This affects around 75% of people eventually diagnosed with the disease. Some instead have \"microscopic haematuria\" – small amounts of blood in the urine that can only be seen under a microscope during urinalysis – pain while urinating, or no symptoms at all (their tumors are detected during unrelated medical imaging). Less commonly, a tumor can block the flow of urine into the bladder; backed up urine can cause the kidneys to swell resulting in pain along the flank of the body between the ribs and the hips. Most people with blood in the urine do not have bladder cancer; up to 22% of those with visible haematuria and 5% with microscopic haematuria are diagnosed with the disease. Women with bladder cancer and haematuria are often misdiagnosed with urinary tract infections, delaying appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Around 3% of people with bladder cancer have tumors that have already spread (metastasized) outside the bladder at the time of diagnosis. Bladder cancer most commonly spreads to the bones, lungs, liver, and nearby lymph nodes. Tumors cause different symptoms in each location. People whose cancer has metastasized to the bones most often experience bone pain or bone weakness that increases the risk of fractures. Lung tumors can cause persistent cough, coughing up blood, breathlessness, or recurrent chest infections. Cancer that has spread to the liver can cause general malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, abdominal pain or swelling, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), and skin itch. Spreading to nearby lymph nodes can cause pain and swelling around the affected lymph nodes, typically in the abdomen or groin. ==",

        "page_content": "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or non-small-cell lung carcinoma, is any type of epithelial lung cancer other than small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC accounts for about 85% of all lung cancers. As a class, NSCLCs are relatively insensitive to chemotherapy, compared to small-cell carcinoma. When possible, they are primarily treated by surgical resection with curative intent, although chemotherapy has been used increasingly both preoperatively (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) and postoperatively (adjuvant chemotherapy). == Types == The most common types of NSCLC are squamous-cell carcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma, but several other types occur less frequently. A few of the less common types are pleomorphic, carcinoid tumor, salivary gland carcinoma, and unclassified carcinoma. All types can occur in unusual histologic variants and as mixed cell-type combinations. Non-squamous-cell carcinoma almost occupies the half of NSCLC. In the tissue classification, the central type contains about one-ninth. Sometimes, the phrase \"not otherwise specified\" (NOS) is used generically, usually when a more specific diagnosis cannot be made. This is most often the case when a pathologist examines a small number of malignant cells or tissue in a cytology or biopsy specimen. Lung cancer in people who have never smoked is almost universally NSCLC, with a sizeable majority being adenocarcinoma. On relatively rare occasions, malignant lung tumors are found to contain components of both SCLC and NSCLC. In these cases, the tumors are classified as combined small-cell lung carcinoma (c-SCLC), and are (usually) treated as \"pure\" SCLC. === Lung adenocarcinoma === Adenocarcinoma of the lung is currently the most common type of lung cancer in \"never smokers\" (lifelong nonsmokers). Adenocarcinomas account for about 40% of lung cancers. Historically, adenocarcinoma was more often seen peripherally in the lungs than SCLC and squamous-cell lung cancer, both of which tended to be more often centrally located. Recent studies, though, suggest that the \"ratio of centrally to peripherally occurring\" lesions may be converging toward unity for both adenocarcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma. ===",

It is closely correlated with a history of tobacco smoking, more so than most other types of lung cancer.

LCLCs have typically comprised around 10% of all NSCLCs in the past, although newer diagnostic techniques seem to be reducing the incidence of diagnosis of \"classic\" LCLC in favor of more poorly differentiated SCCs and adenocarcinomas. LCLC is, in effect, a \"diagnosis of exclusion\", in that the tumor cells lack light microscopic characteristics that would classify the neoplasm as a small-cell carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or another more specific histologic type of lung cancer. LCLC is differentiated from SCLC primarily by the larger size of the anaplastic cells, a higher cytoplasmic-to-nuclear size ratio, and a lack of \"salt-and-pepper\" chromatin. == Signs and symptoms == Many of the symptoms of NSCLC can be signs of other diseases, but having chronic or overlapping symptoms may be a signal of the presence of the disease.

Risk factors include a family history of chronic kidney disease. Diagnosis is by blood tests to measure the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and a urine test to measure albumin. Ultrasound or kidney biopsy may be performed to determine the underlying cause. Several severity-based staging systems are in use. Testing people with risk factors (case-finding) is recommended. Initial treatments may include medications to lower blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor antagonists (ARBs) are generally first-line agents for blood pressure control, as they slow progression of the kidney disease and the risk of heart disease. Loop diuretics may be used to control edema and, if needed, to further lower blood pressure. NSAIDs should be avoided. Other recommended measures include staying active, and \"to adopt healthy and diverse diets with a higher consumption of plant-based foods compared to animal-based foods and a lower consumption of ultraprocessed foods.\" Plant-based diets are feasible and are associated with improved intermediate outcomes and biomarkers. An example of a general, healthy diet, suitable for people with CKD who do not require restrictions, is the Canada Food Guide Diet. People with CKD who require dietary restrictions or who have other specific nutritional problems should be referred to a dietitian. Treatments for anemia and bone disease may also be required.

        "page_content": "Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a vascular disorder that causes abnormal narrowing of arteries other than those that supply the heart or brain. PAD can happen in any blood vessel, but it is more common in the legs than the arms. When narrowing occurs in the heart, it is called coronary artery disease (CAD), and in the brain, it is called cerebrovascular disease. Peripheral artery disease most commonly affects the legs, but other arteries may also be involved, such as those of the arms, neck, or kidneys. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a form of peripheral vascular disease. Vascular refers to the arteries and veins within the body. PAD differs from peripheral veinous disease. PAD means the arteries are narrowed or blocked—the vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood as it moves from the heart to other parts of the body. Peripheral veinous disease, on the other hand, refers to problems with veins—the vessels that bring the blood back to the heart. The classic symptom is leg pain when walking, which resolves with rest and is known as intermittent claudication. Other symptoms include skin ulcers, bluish skin, cold skin, or abnormal nail and hair growth in the affected leg. Complications may include an infection or tissue death, which may require amputation; coronary artery disease; or stroke. Up to 50% of people with PAD do not have symptoms. The greatest risk factor for PAD is cigarette smoking. Other risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney problems, and high blood cholesterol. PAD is primarily caused by the buildup of fatty plaque in the arteries, which is called atherosclerosis, especially in individuals over 40 years old. Other mechanisms include artery spasm, blood clots, trauma, fibromuscular dysplasia, and vasculitis. PAD is typically diagnosed by finding an ankle-brachial index (ABI) less than 0.90, which is the systolic blood pressure at the ankle divided by the systolic blood pressure of the arm. Duplex ultrasonography and angiography may also be used. Angiography is more accurate and allows for treatment at the same time; however, it is associated with greater risks. It is unclear if screening for peripheral artery disease in people without symptoms is useful, as it has not been properly studied. For those with intermittent claudication from PAD, stopping smoking and supervised exercise therapy may improve outcomes. Medications, including statins, ACE inhibitors, and cilostazol, may also help. Aspirin, which helps with thinning the blood and thus improving blood flow, does not appear to help those with mild disease but is usually recommended for those with more significant disease due to the increased risk of heart attacks. Anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as warfarin show no definitive scientific evidence of benefit in PAD. Surgical procedures used to treat PAD include bypass grafting, angioplasty, and atherectomy. In 2015, about 155 million people had PAD worldwide. It becomes more common with age. In the developed world, it affects about 5.3% of 45- to 50-year-olds and 18.6% of 85- to 90-year-olds. In the developing world, it affects 4.6% of people between the ages of 45 and 50 and 15% of people between the ages of 85 and 90. PAD in the developed world is equally common among men and women, though in the developing world, women are more commonly affected. In 2015, PAD resulted in about 52,500 deaths, which is an increase from the 16,000 deaths in 1990. ==",

There is some evidence for SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists, pioglitazone, vitamin E and milk thistle in the treatment of MASLD. In March 2024, resmetirom was the first drug approved by the FDA for MASH. Those with MASH have a 2.6% increased risk of dying per year. MASLD is the most common liver disorder in the world; about 25% of people have it. It is very common in developed nations, such as the United States, and affected about 75 to 100 million Americans in 2017. Over 90% of obese, 60% of diabetic, and up to 20% of normal-weight people develop MASLD. MASLD was the leading cause of chronic liver disease and the second most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States and Europe in 2017. MASLD affects about 20 to 25% of people in Europe. In the United States, estimates suggest that 30% to 40% of adults have MASLD, and about 3% to 12% of adults have MASH. The annual economic burden was about US$103 billion in the United States in 2016. == Definition == An abnormal accumulation of fat in the liver in the absence of secondary causes of fatty liver, such as significant alcohol use, viral hepatitis, or medications that can induce fatty liver, was the definition of NAFLD. However, the term MASLD accepts there may be other conditions present, but focuses on the metabolic abnormalities contributing to the disorder. MASLD encompasses a continuum of liver abnormalities, from metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver (MASL, simple steatosis) to Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). These diseases begin with fatty accumulation in the liver (hepatic steatosis). A liver can remain fatty without disturbing liver function (MASL), but by various mechanisms and possible insults to the liver, it may also progress into steatohepatitis (MASH), a state in which steatosis is combined with inflammation and sometimes fibrosis. MASH can then lead to complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The new name, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), was proposed after 70% of a panel of experts expressed support for this name. This new name was adopted in 2023. == Signs and symptoms == People with MASLD often have no noticeable symptoms, and it is often only detected during routine blood tests or unrelated abdominal imaging or liver biopsy. In some cases, it can cause symptoms related to liver dysfunction such as fatigue",

Treating people who have strep throat with antibiotics can decrease the risk of rheumatic heart disease. The use of aspirin in people who are otherwise healthy is of unclear benefit. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide except Africa. Together CVD resulted in 17.9 million deaths (32.1%) in 2015, up from 12.3 million (25.8%) in 1990. Deaths, at a given age, from CVD are more common and have been increasing in much of the developing world, while rates have declined in most of the developed world since the 1970s. Coronary artery disease and stroke account for 80% of CVD deaths in males and 75% of CVD deaths in females. Most cardiovascular disease affects older adults. In high income countries, the mean age at first cardiovascular disease diagnosis lies around 70 years (73 years in women, 68 years in men). In the United States 11% of people between 20 and 40 have CVD, while 37% between 40 and 60, 71% of people between 60 and 80, and 85% of people over 80 have CVD. The average age of death from coronary artery disease in the developed world is around 80, while it is around 68 in the developing world. At same age, men are about 50% more likely to develop CVD and are typically diagnosed seven to ten years earlier in men than in women. == Types == There are many cardiovascular diseases involving the blood vessels. They are known as vascular diseases. Coronary artery disease (coronary heart disease or ischemic heart disease) Peripheral arterial disease – a disease of blood vessels that supply blood to the arms and legs Cerebrovascular disease – a disease of blood vessels that supply blood to the brain (includes stroke) Renal artery stenosis Aortic aneurysm There are also many cardiovascular diseases that involve the heart. Cardiomyopathy – diseases of cardiac muscle Hypertensive heart disease – diseases of the heart secondary to high blood pressure or hypertension Heart failure – a clinical syndrome caused by the inability of the heart to supply sufficient blood to the tissues to meet their metabolic requirements Pulmonary heart disease – a failure at the right side of the heart with respiratory system involvement Cardiac dysrhythmias – abnormalities of heart rhythm Inflammatory heart diseases Endocarditis – inflammation of the inner layer of the heart, the endocardium. The structures most commonly involved are the heart valves. Inflammatory cardiomegaly Myocarditis – inflammation of the myocardium, the muscular part of the heart, caused most often by viral infection and less often by bacterial infections, certain medications, toxins, and autoimmun",

NCDs include Parkinson's disease, autoimmune diseases, strokes, heart diseases, cancers, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, cataracts, and others. NCDs may be chronic or acute. Most are non-infectious, although there are some non-communicable infectious diseases, such as parasitic diseases in which the parasite's life cycle does not include direct host-to-host transmission. The four main NCDs that are the leading causes of death globally are cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes. NCDs account for seven out of the ten leading causes of death worldwide. Figures given for 2019 are 41 million deaths due to NCDs worldwide. Of these 17.9 million were due to cardiovascular disease; 9.3 million due to cancer; 4.1 million to chronic respiratory diseases, and 2.0 million to diabetes. Over 80% of the deaths from these four groups were premature, not reaching the age of 70. Risk factors such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment increase the likelihood of certain NCDs. Every year, at least 5 million people die because of tobacco use and about 2.8 million die from being overweight. High cholesterol accounts for roughly 2.6 million deaths and 7.5 million die because of high blood pressure. == Risk factors == Risk factors such as a person's background; lifestyle and environment are known to increase the likelihood of certain non-communicable diseases. They include age, gender, genetics, exposure to air pollution, and behaviors such as smoking, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity which can lead to hypertension and obesity, in turn leading to increased risk of many NCDs. Most NCDs are considered preventable because they are caused by modifiable risk factors. The WHO's World Health Report 2002 identified five important risk factors for non-communicable disease in the top ten leading risks to health. These are raised blood pressure, raised cholesterol, tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and being overweight. The other factors associated with higher risk of NCDs include a person's economic and social conditions, also known as the social determinants of health. It has been estimated that if the primary risk factors were eliminated, 80% of the cases of heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes and 40% of cancers could be prevented. Interventions targeting the main risk factors could have a significant impact on reducing the burden of disease worldwide. Efforts focused on better diet and increased physical activity have been shown to control the prevalence of NCDs .",

Within neurodegenerative diseases, it is estimated that 55 million people worldwide had dementia in 2019, and that by 2050 this figure will increase to 139 million people. == Specific disorders == The consequences of neurodegeneration can vary widely depending on the specific region affected, ranging from issues related to movement to the development of dementia. === Alzheimer's disease === Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that results in the loss of neurons and synapses in the cerebral cortex and certain subcortical structures, resulting in gross atrophy of the temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and parts of the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus. It is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Even with billions of dollars being used to find a treatment for Alzheimer's disease, no effective treatments have been found. Within clinical trials stable and effective AD therapeutic strategies have a 99.5% failure rate. Reasons for this failure rate include inappropriate drug doses, invalid target and participant selection, and inadequate knowledge of pathophysiology of AD. Currently, diagnoses of Alzheimer's is subpar, and better methods need to be utilized for various aspects of clinical diagnoses. Alzheimer's has a 20% misdiagnosis rate. AD pathology is primarily characterized by the presence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Plaques are made up of small peptides, typically 39–43 amino acids in length, called amyloid beta (also written as A-beta or Aβ). Amyloid beta is a fragment from a larger protein called amyloid precursor protein (APP), a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP appears to play roles in normal neuron growth, survival and post-injury repair. APP is cleaved into smaller fragments by enzymes such as gamma secretase and beta secretase. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of amyloid beta which can self-assemble into the dense extracellular amyloid plaques. === Parkinson's disease === Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. It typically manifests as bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor and posture instability. The crude prevalence rate of PD has been reported to range from 15 per 100,000 to 12,500 per 100,000, and the incidence of PD from 15 per 100,000 to 328 per 100,000, with the disease being less common in Asian countries. PD is primarily characterized by death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. The cause of this selective cell death is unknown. Notably, alpha-synuclein-ubiquitin complexes and aggregates are observed to accumulate in Lewy bodies within affected neurons. It is thought that defects in protein transport machinery and regulation, such as RAB1, may play a role in this disease mechanism. Impaired axonal transport of alpha-synuclein may also lead to its accumulation in",

        "page_content": "Parkinson's disease (PD), or simply Parkinson's, is a neurodegenerative disease primarily of the central nervous system, affecting both motor and non-motor systems. Symptoms typically develop gradually and non-motor issues become more prevalent as the disease progresses. The motor symptoms are collectively called parkinsonism and include tremors, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability (i.e., difficulty maintaining balance). Non-motor symptoms develop later in the disease and include behavioral changes or neuropsychiatric problems, such as sleep abnormalities, psychosis, anosmia, and mood swings. Most Parkinson's disease cases are idiopathic, though contributing factors have been identified. Pathophysiology involves progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the substantia nigra, a midbrain region that provides dopamine to the basal ganglia, a system involved in voluntary motor control. The cause of this cell death is poorly understood, but involves the aggregation of alpha-synuclein into Lewy bodies within neurons. Other potential factors involve genetic and environmental influences, medications, lifestyle, and prior health conditions. Diagnosis is primarily based on signs and symptoms, typically motor-related, identified through neurological examination. Medical imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography can support the diagnosis. PD typically manifests in individuals over 60, with about one percent affected. In those younger than 50, it is termed \"early-onset PD\". No cure for PD is known, and treatment focuses on alleviating symptoms. Initial treatment typically includes levodopa, MAO-B inhibitors, or dopamine agonists. As the disease progresses, these medications become less effective and may cause involuntary muscle movements. Diet and rehabilitation therapies can help improve symptoms. Deep brain stimulation is used to manage severe motor symptoms when drugs are ineffective. Little evidence exists for treatments addressing non-motor symptoms, such as sleep disturbances and mood instability. Life expectancy for those with PD is near-normal, but is decreased for early-onset. == Classification and terminology == Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems, characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain. It is classified as a synucleinopathy due to the abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein, which aggregates into Lewy bodies within affected neurons. The loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra causes movement abnormalities, leading to Parkinson's further categorization as a movement disorder. In 30% of cases, disease progression leads to the cognitive decline, resulting in Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Alongside dementia with Lewy bodies, PDD is one of the two subtypes of Lewy body dementia. The four cardinal motor symptoms of Parkinson's—bradykinesia (slowed movements), postural instability, rigidity, and tremor—are called parkinsonism. These four symptoms are not exclusive to Parkinson's and can occur in many other conditions, including HIV infection and recreational drug use. Neurodegenerative diseases that feature parkinsonism, but have distinct differences are grouped under the umbrella of Parkinson-plus syndromes, or alternatively, atypical parkinsonian disorders. PD can be attributed to genetic factors, but most cases are idiopathic, with no clearly identifiable cause. ==",

It is the most common disease spread by ticks in the Northern Hemisphere. Infections are most common in the spring and early summer. The most common sign of infection is an expanding red rash, known as erythema migrans (EM), which appears at the site of the tick bite about a week afterwards. The rash is typically neither itchy nor painful. Approximately 70–80% of infected people develop a rash. Other early symptoms may include fever, headaches and tiredness. If untreated, symptoms may include loss of the ability to move one or both sides of the face, joint pains, severe headaches with neck stiffness or heart palpitations. Months to years later, repeated episodes of joint pain and swelling may occur. Occasionally, shooting pains or tingling in the arms and legs may develop. Diagnosis is based on a combination of symptoms, history of tick exposure, and possibly testing for specific antibodies in the blood. If an infection develops, several antibiotics are effective, including doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime. Standard treatment usually lasts for two or three weeks. People with persistent symptoms after appropriate treatments are said to have Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS). Prevention includes efforts to prevent tick bites by wearing clothing to cover the arms and legs and using DEET or picaridin-based insect repellents. As of 2023, clinical trials of proposed human vaccines for Lyme disease were being carried out, but no vaccine was available. A vaccine, LYMERix, was produced but discontinued in 2002 due to insufficient demand. There are several vaccines for the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs. == Signs and symptoms == Lyme disease can produce a broad range of symptoms. The incubation period is usually one to two weeks, but can be much shorter (days) or much longer (months to years). Lyme symptoms most often occur from May to September in the Northern Hemisphere because the nymphal stage of the tick is responsible for most cases. ===",

        "page_content": "Early localized infection === Approximately 80% of Lyme infections begin with a rash of some sort at the site of a tick bite, often near skin folds such as the armpit, groin, back of the knee, or the trunk under clothing straps, or in children's hair, ears, or neck. Most people who get infected do not remember seeing a tick or a bite. The rash appears typically one or two weeks (range 3–32 days) after the bite and expands 2–3 cm (around 1 inch) per day up to a diameter of 5–70 cm (2 to 28 inches) (median is 16 cm; 6 inches). The rash is usually circular or oval, red or bluish, and may have an elevated or darker center. This rash is termed an erythema migrans (EM), which translates as \"migrating redness.\" In approximately 79% of cases in Europe, this rash gradually clears from the center toward the edges, possibly forming a \"bull's eye\" or \"target-like\" pattern. This clearing only happens in 19% of cases in endemic areas of the United States. The rash may feel warm, usually is not itchy, is rarely tender or painful, and takes up to four weeks to resolve if untreated. The Lyme rash is often accompanied by symptoms of a flu-like illness, including fatigue, headache, body aches, fever, and chills [though usually neither nausea nor upper-respiratory problems]. These symptoms may also appear without a rash or linger after the rash has disappeared. Lyme can progress to later stages without a rash or these symptoms. People with high fever for more than two days or whose other symptoms of viral-like illness do not improve despite antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, or who have abnormally low levels of white or red cells or platelets in the blood, should be investigated for possible coinfection with other tick-borne diseases such as ehrlichiosis and babesiosis.

Clinical trials generate data on dosage, safety and efficacy. They are conducted only after they have received health authority/ethics committee approval in the country where approval of the therapy is sought. These authorities are responsible for vetting the risk/benefit ratio of the trial—their approval does not mean the therapy is 'safe' or effective, only that the trial may be conducted. Depending on product type and development stage, investigators initially enroll volunteers or patients into small pilot studies, and subsequently conduct progressively larger scale comparative studies. Clinical trials can vary in size and cost, and they can involve a single research center or multiple centers, in one country or in multiple countries. Clinical study design aims to ensure the scientific validity and reproducibility of the results. Costs for clinical trials can range into the billions of dollars per approved drug, and the complete trial process to approval may require 7–15 years. The sponsor may be a governmental organization or a pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical-device company. Certain functions necessary to the trial, such as monitoring and lab work, may be managed by an outsourced partner, such as a contract research organization or a central laboratory.

Other clinical trials pertain to people with specific health conditions who are willing to try an experimental treatment. Pilot experiments are conducted to gain insights for design of the clinical trial to follow. There are two goals to testing medical treatments: to learn whether they work well enough, called \"efficacy\", or \"effectiveness\"; and to learn whether they are safe enough, called \"safety\". Neither is an absolute criterion; both safety and efficacy are evaluated relative to how the treatment is intended to be used, what other treatments are available, and the severity of the disease or condition. The benefits must outweigh the risks. For example, many drugs to treat cancer have severe side effects that would not be acceptable for an over-the-counter pain medication, yet the cancer drugs have been approved since they are used under a physician's care and are used for a life-threatening condition. In the US the elderly constitute 14% of the population, while they consume over one-third of drugs. People over 55 (or a similar cutoff age) are often excluded from trials because their greater health issues and drug use complicate data interpretation, and because they have different physiological capacity than younger people. Children and people with unrelated medical conditions are also frequently excluded. Pregnant women are often excluded due to potential risks to the fetus. The sponsor designs the trial in coordination with a panel of expert clinical investigators, including what alternative or existing treatments to compare to the new drug and what type(s) of patients might benefit. If the sponsor cannot obtain enough test subjects at one location investigators at other locations are recruited to join the study. During the trial, investigators recruit subjects with the predetermined characteristics, administer the treatment(s) and collect data on the subjects' health for a defined time period. Data include measurements such as vital signs, concentration of the study drug in the blood or tissues, changes to symptoms, and whether improvement or worsening of the condition targeted by the study",

        "page_content": "Definition and examples == An RCT in clinical research typically compares a proposed new treatment against an existing standard of care; these are then termed the 'experimental' and 'control' treatments, respectively. When no such generally accepted treatment is available, a placebo may be used in the control group so that participants are blinded, or not given information, about their treatment allocations. This blinding principle is ideally also extended as much as possible to other parties including researchers, technicians, data analysts, and evaluators. Effective blinding experimentally isolates the physiological effects of treatments from various psychological sources of bias. The randomness in the assignment of participants to treatments reduces selection bias and allocation bias, balancing both known and unknown prognostic factors, in the assignment of treatments. Blinding reduces other forms of experimenter and subject biases. A well-blinded RCT is considered the gold standard for clinical trials. Blinded RCTs are commonly used to test the efficacy of medical interventions and may additionally provide information about adverse effects, such as drug reactions. A randomized controlled trial can provide compelling evidence that the study treatment causes an effect on human health. The terms \"RCT\" and \"randomized trial\" are sometimes used synonymously, but the latter term omits mention of controls and can therefore describe studies that compare multiple treatment groups with each other in the absence of a control group. Similarly, the initialism is sometimes expanded as \"randomized clinical trial\" or \"randomized comparative trial\", leading to ambiguity in the scientific literature. Not all RCTs are randomized controlled trials (and some of them could never be, as in cases where controls would be impractical or unethical to use). The term randomized controlled clinical trial is an alternative term used in clinical research; however, RCTs are also employed in other research areas, including many of the social sciences. ==",

The first blind experiment was conducted by the French Royal Commission on Animal Magnetism in 1784 to investigate the claims of mesmerism. An early essay advocating the blinding of researchers came from Claude Bernard in the latter half of the 19th century. Bernard recommended that the observer of an experiment should not have knowledge of the hypothesis being tested. This suggestion contrasted starkly with the prevalent Enlightenment-era attitude that scientific observation can only be objectively valid when undertaken by a well-educated, informed scientist. The first study recorded to have a blinded researcher was published in 1907 by W. H. R. Rivers and H. N. Webber to investigate the effects of caffeine. Randomized experiments first appeared in psychology, where they were introduced by Charles Sanders Peirce and Joseph Jastrow in the 1880s, and in education.

Meta-scientific research has shown that the percentage of non-significant results in Registered Reports is substantially higher than in standard publications. === Specialized preregistration === Preregistration can be used in relation to a variety of different research designs and methods, including: Quantitative research in psychology Qualitative research Preexisting data Single case designs Electroencephalogram research Experience sampling Exploratory research Animal Research == Clinical trial registration == Clinical trial registration is the practice of documenting clinical trials before they are performed in a clinical trials registry so as to combat publication bias and",

        "page_content": "Pharmacokinetics (from Ancient Greek pharmakon \"drug\" and kinetikos \"moving, putting in motion\"; see chemical kinetics), sometimes abbreviated as PK, is a branch of pharmacology dedicated to describing how the body affects a specific substance after administration. The substances of interest include any chemical xenobiotic such as pharmaceutical drugs, pesticides, food additives, cosmetics, etc. It attempts to analyze chemical metabolism and to discover the fate of a chemical from the moment that it is administered up to the point at which it is completely eliminated from the body. Pharmacokinetics is based on mathematical modeling that places great emphasis on the relationship between drug plasma concentration and the time elapsed since the drug's administration. Pharmacokinetics is the study of how an organism affects the drug, whereas pharmacodynamics (PD) is the study of how the drug affects the organism. Both together influence dosing, benefit, and adverse effects, as seen in PK/PD models. == ADME == A number of phases occur once the drug enters into contact with the organism, these are described using the acronym ADME (or LADME if liberation is included as a separate step from absorption): Liberation – the process of the active ingredient separating from its pharmaceutical formulation. See also IVIVC. Absorption – the process of a drug entering into systemic circulation from the site of administration Distribution – the dispersion or dissemination of substances throughout the fluids and tissues of the body. Metabolism (or biotransformation, or inactivation) – the chemical reactions of the drug and irreversible breakdown into metabolites (e.g. by metabolic enzymes such as cytochrome P450 or glucuronosyltransferase enzymes) Excretion – the removal of the substance or metabolites from the body. In rare cases, some drugs irreversibly accumulate in body tissue. Some textbooks combine the first two phases as the drug is often administered in an active form, which means that there is no liberation phase. Others include a phase that combines distribution, metabolism and excretion into a disposition phase. Other authors include the drug's toxicological aspect in what is known as ADME-Tox or ADMET. The two phases of metabolism and excretion can be grouped together under the title elimination. The study of these distinct phases involves the use and manipulation of basic concepts in order to understand the process dynamics. For this reason, in order to fully comprehend the kinetics of a drug it is necessary to have detailed knowledge of a number of factors such as: the properties of the substances that act as excipients, the characteristics of the appropriate biological membranes and the way that substances can cross them, or the characteristics of the enzyme reactions that inactivate the drug. ==",

Testosterone is a naturally occurring and bioidentical AAS, or an agonist of the androgen receptor, the biological target of androgens like endogenous testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Testosterone is used by both men and women and can be taken by a variety of different routes of administration. == Routes of administration == Testosterone can be taken by a variety of different routes of administration. These include oral, buccal, sublingual, intranasal, transdermal (gels, creams, patches, solutions), vaginal (creams, gels, suppositories), rectal (suppositories), by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection (in oil solutions or aqueous suspensions), and as a subcutaneous implant. The pharmacokinetics of testosterone, including its bioavailability, metabolism, biological half-life, and other parameters, differ by route of administration. Likewise, the potency of testosterone, and its local effects in certain tissues, for instance the liver, differ by route of administration as well. In particular, the oral route is subject to a high first-pass effect, which results in high levels of testosterone in the liver and consequent hepatic androgenic effects, as well as low potency due to first-pass metabolism in the intestines and liver into metabolites like dihydrotestosterone and androgen conjugates. Conversely, this is not the case for non-oral routes, which bypass the first pass. Different testosterone routes and dosages can achieve widely varying circulating testosterone levels. For purposes of comparison with normal physiological circumstances, circulating levels of total testosterone in men range from about 250 to 1,100 ng/dL (mean 630 ng/dL) and in women range from about 2 to 50 ng/dL (mean 32 ng/dL). Testosterone levels decline with age in men. In women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition of androgen excess, testosterone levels are typically around 50 to 80 ng/dL, with a range of about 30 to 140 ng/dL. Total testosterone levels are about 20-fold and free testosterone levels about 40-fold higher in men than in women on average. Similarly, testosterone production is approximately 30 times higher in men than in women. ===",

It is rapidly and completely inactivated in men at doses of less than 200 mg. In large doses, such as 200 mg however, significant increases in circulating testosterone levels become apparent. In addition, while a 60 mg dose has no effect on testosterone levels in men, this dose does measurably increase testosterone levels in prepubertal boys and women. The oral bioavailability of testosterone in young women after a single 25 mg dose was found to be 3.6 ± 2.5%. High levels of testosterone are also achieved with a 60 mg dose of oral testosterone in men with liver cirrhosis. These findings are attributed to induction of liver enzymes by testosterone and consequent activation of its own metabolism. Substitution dosages of oral testosterone in men are in the range of 400 to 800 mg/day. Such doses exceed the amount of testosterone produced by the body, which is approximately 7 mg/day, by approximately 100-fold. The elimination half-life of oral testosterone is rapid at about 5 to 7 hours. As a result, it requires administration several times per day in divided doses. Due to its limitations, such as the high doses required and necessity of multiple daily doses, oral testosterone is not used clinically in its unmodified form. Oral testosterone has been studied in combination with a 5α-reductase inhibitor to reduce its first-pass metabolism and improve its bioavailability. ==== Oral testosterone",

        "page_content": "Drug metabolism is the metabolic breakdown of drugs by living organisms, usually through specialized enzymatic systems. More generally, xenobiotic metabolism (from the Greek xenos \"stranger\" and biotic \"related to living beings\") is the set of metabolic pathways that modify the chemical structure of xenobiotics, which are compounds foreign to an organism's normal biochemistry, such as any drug or poison. These pathways are a form of biotransformation present in all major groups of organisms and are considered to be of ancient origin. These reactions often act to detoxify poisonous compounds (although in some cases the intermediates in xenobiotic metabolism can themselves cause toxic effects). The study of drug metabolism is the object of pharmacokinetics. Metabolism is one of the stages (see ADME) of the drug's transit through the body that involves the breakdown of the drug so that it can be excreted by the body. The metabolism of pharmaceutical drugs is an important aspect of pharmacology and medicine. For example, the rate of metabolism determines the duration and intensity of a drug's pharmacologic action. Drug metabolism also affects multidrug resistance in infectious diseases and in chemotherapy for cancer, and the actions of some drugs as substrates or inhibitors of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism are a common reason for hazardous drug interactions. These pathways are also important in environmental science, with the xenobiotic metabolism of microorganisms determining whether a pollutant will be broken down during bioremediation, or persist in the environment. The enzymes of xenobiotic metabolism, particularly the glutathione S-transferases are also important in agriculture, since they may produce resistance to pesticides and herbicides. Drug metabolism is divided into three phases. In phase I, enzymes such as Cytochrome P450 oxidases introduce reactive or polar groups into xenobiotics. These modified compounds are then conjugated to polar compounds in phase II reactions. These reactions are catalyzed by transferase enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases. Finally, in phase III, the conjugated xenobiotics may be further processed, before being recognized by efflux transporters and pumped out of cells. Drug metabolism often converts lipophilic compounds into hydrophilic products that are more readily excreted. ==",

        "page_content": "Permeability barriers and detoxification == The exact compounds an organism is exposed to will be largely unpredictable, and may differ widely over time; these are major characteristics of xenobiotic toxic stress. The major challenge faced by xenobiotic detoxification systems is that they must be able to remove the almost-limitless number of xenobiotic compounds from the complex mixture of chemicals involved in normal metabolism. The solution that has evolved to address this problem is an elegant combination of physical barriers and low-specificity enzymatic systems. All organisms use cell membranes as hydrophobic permeability barriers to control access to their internal environment. Polar compounds cannot diffuse across these cell membranes, and the uptake of useful molecules is mediated through transport proteins that specifically select substrates from the extracellular mixture. This selective uptake means that most hydrophilic molecules cannot enter cells, since they are not recognized by any specific transporters. In contrast, the diffusion of hydrophobic compounds across these barriers cannot be controlled, and organisms, therefore, cannot exclude lipid-soluble xenobiotics using membrane barriers. However, the existence of a permeability barrier means that organisms were able to evolve detoxification systems that exploit the hydrophobicity common to membrane-permeable xenobiotics. These systems therefore solve the specificity problem by possessing such broad substrate specificities that they metabolize almost any non-polar compound.

The effect is most studied with grapefruit and grapefruit juice, but similar effects have been observed with certain other citrus fruits. One whole grapefruit, or a small glass (200 mL, 6.8 US fl oz) of grapefruit juice, can cause drug overdose toxicity in patients taking felodipine. Fruit consumed three days before the medicine can still have an effect. The relative risks of different types of citrus fruit have not been systematically studied. Affected drugs typically have an auxiliary label saying \"Do not take with grapefruit\" on the container, and the interaction is elaborated upon in the package insert. People are advised to ask their physician or pharmacist about drug interactions. However, some experts believe that for the majority of patients, complete avoidance of grapefruit is unwarranted. Although a prospective cohort study of middle-aged women indicated that some flavonoid-rich foods are associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality, frequent grapefruit consumption was associated with a small increase in all-cause mortality, possibly because of the clinically significant drug interactions of the non-flavonoid components. == History == The effect of grapefruit juice with regard to drug absorption was originally discovered in 1989 by a group led by pharmacologist David Bailey. Their first published clinical report on grapefruit drug interactions was in 1991. The effect was first discovered accidentally in 1989, when a test of drug interactions with alcohol used grapefruit juice to hide the taste of the ethanol. A 2005 medical review advised patients to avoid all citrus juices until further research clarifies the risks. It was reported in 2008 that similar effects had been observed with apple juice. == Polyphenols == Citrus fruits contain various polyphenols, which may include furanocoumarins and naringin, such as bergamottin, dihydroxybergamottin, and bergapten.

These chemicals inhibit key drug metabolizing enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). CYP3A4 is a metabolizing enzyme for almost 50% of drugs, and is found in the liver and small intestinal epithelial cells. Organic derivatives of furanocoumarin interfere with liver and intestinal enzyme CYP3A4 and may be responsible for the effects of grapefruit on the enzyme. Cytochrome isoforms affected by grapefruit components include CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, but CYP3A4 is the major CYP enzyme in the intestine. Inhibition of enzymes can have two different effects: grapefruit juice-mediated inhibition of enzymes that metabolize the drug to an inactive metabolite leads to too high doses of the drug in the body grapefruit juice-mediated inhibition of membrane transport proteins from the intestine to the blood, or inhibition of enzymes that activates a prodrug to an active metabolite leads to insufficient doses of the drug in the body resulting in loss of theurapeutic effect Grapefruit or grapefruit juice can reduce the absorption of many drugs by inhibiting transport across cell membranes by the transporters P-glycoprotein (a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters) and members of the organo anion transporter family. These transporters appear to have a minimal effect on systemic exposure of the drugs they affect, however. Many drugs are affected by consumption of citrus juice. When the metabolizing enzyme is inhibited, less of the drug will be metabolized by it in the epithelial cells.

Estradiol is a naturally occurring and bioidentical estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like endogenous estradiol. Due to its estrogenic activity, estradiol has antigonadotropic effects and can inhibit fertility and suppress sex hormone production in both women and men. Estradiol differs from non-bioidentical estrogens like conjugated estrogens and ethinylestradiol in various ways, with implications for tolerability and safety. Estradiol can be taken by mouth, held under the tongue, as a gel or patch that is applied to the skin, in through the vagina, by injection into muscle or fat, or through the use of an implant that is placed into fat, among other routes. == Routes of administration == Estradiol can be taken by a variety of different routes of administration. These include oral, buccal, sublingual, intranasal, transdermal (gels, creams, patches), vaginal (tablets, creams, rings, suppositories), rectal, by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection (in oil or aqueous), and as a subcutaneous implant. The pharmacokinetics of estradiol, including its bioavailability, metabolism, biological half-life, and other parameters, differ by route of administration. Likewise, the potency of estradiol, and its local effects in certain tissues, most importantly the liver, differ by route of administration as well.

Conversely, this is not the case for parenteral (non-oral) routes, which bypass the intestines and liver. Different estradiol routes and dosages can achieve widely varying circulating estradiol levels (see the table below). For purposes of comparison with normal physiological circumstances, menstrual cycle circulating levels of estradiol in premenopausal women are 40 pg/mL in the early follicular phase, 250 pg/mL at the middle of the cycle, and 100 pg/mL during the mid-luteal phase. Mean integrated levels of circulating estradiol in premenopausal women across the whole menstrual cycle are in the range of 80 to 150 pg/mL, according to some sources. In postmenopausal women, circulating levels of estradiol are below 15 pg/mL. During normal human pregnancy, estrogen production increases progressively and extremely high estrogen levels are attained. Estradiol levels range from 1,000 to 40,000 pg/mL across pregnancy, are on average 25,000 pg/mL at term, and reach levels as high as 75,000 pg/mL in some women. ===",

        "page_content": "Oral administration === ==== Absorption and bioavailability ==== The oral bioavailability of estradiol is very low. This is due to the fact that estradiol is poorly soluble in water, which limits its dissolution and absorption, and is additionally subject to extensive metabolism during the first pass through the intestines and liver. Estradiol is micronized and/or conjugated with an ester, as in estradiol valerate or estradiol acetate, to improve its oral bioavailability and potency. Micronization decreases the particle size of estradiol crystals and hence increases the surface area for absorption, thereby improving the rate and extent of absorption. In addition, there is an improvement in metabolic stability. Oral micronized estradiol consists of more than 80% of estradiol particles micronized to a size smaller than 20 μm in diameter, or to about 1 to 3 μm on average. All oral formulations of estradiol available today are micronized, and oral estradiol valerate tablets also seem to be micronized. Oral non-micronized estradiol and oral micronized estradiol do not appear to have ever been directly compared in a study. B",
